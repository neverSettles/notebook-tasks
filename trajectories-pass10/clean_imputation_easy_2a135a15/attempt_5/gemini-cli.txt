I will create the Jupyter notebook with the required data cleaning and imputation steps.
I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. 

It uses `pandas` to perform all the steps you requested: setting the 'Date' index, doing a forward fill (`ffill()`) on 'Revenue', imputing the mean for 'Expenses', calculating 'Profit', and saving the results to `/home/user/cleaned_financial_data.csv` with the index intact. The notebook is properly formatted as a JSON `.ipynb` file and can be executed natively using `jupyter nbconvert`.
