I will create the requested Jupyter notebook to clean and impute the financial data.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. It is correctly formatted to read the financial dataset, impute the necessary values, calculate profit, and save the result as requested, and is fully executable via `jupyter nbconvert`.
