I am creating the requested Jupyter notebook to clean the financial data.

I have created the well-structured Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. It is formatted as valid JSON under the hood and includes all the requested pandas data cleaning steps. 

It's ready to be executed using:
`jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`
