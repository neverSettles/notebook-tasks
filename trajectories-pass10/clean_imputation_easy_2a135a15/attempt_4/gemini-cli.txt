I will write the Jupyter notebook with the required pandas data cleaning steps.

I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. 

It correctly implements all steps using pandas, and its structured JSON format ensures it can be executed right away with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`.
