I will create a Jupyter Notebook file containing the Python code necessary to load, clean, impute, and save the financial data as you specified.

I have created the Jupyter notebook `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb` containing the requested pandas data cleaning steps. The notebook is well-formatted and can be executed via `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`.
