I will create the Jupyter notebook that performs the required ETL pipeline and Exploratory Data Analysis by writing a structured JSON file to `/home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb`.
I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb` conforming precisely to your requirements. 

The notebook has the correct structure and includes cells in the specific order requested:
1.  **Merging:** Loads and merges `/home/user/plot_metadata.csv` and `/home/user/yield_data.csv` using an inner join on `plot_id`.
2.  **Cleaning:** Filters the data using conditions `daily_temp <= 50` and `daily_rainfall >= 0` to remove anomalous rows.
3.  **Aggregation:** Groups by `fertilizer`, computes means for `yield_kg` and `daily_temp`, and successfully writes out exactly to `/home/user/summary_stats.json`.
4.  **Plotting:** Generates and saves the scatter plot (`temp_vs_yield.png`).
5.  **Saving Clean Data:** Persists the final cleaned subset locally as requested to `/home/user/clean_experiment_data.csv`.
6.  **Validations:** Contains the necessary `assert` validations loading from the output dataset to mathematically guarantee the dataset lengths and thresholds.

This notebook is ready for execution with `jupyter nbconvert`.
