I will create the Jupyter Notebook file at the specified path to iterate over your raw data files, aggregate the results, and save them to a JSON file. First, I'll write the notebook's JSON structure directly to disk.
I've successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

The notebook implements all your requests:
1. **Batch Processing & Error Handling:** It iterates over files matching `campaign_day_*.csv`, wrapped in `try...except` to catch malformed files (and asserts the expected `user_id`, `group`, and `converted` columns exist). Status messages are printed as it processes.
2. **Data Aggregation:** It safely isolates the valid records, aggregating impressions, conversions, and computing the conversion rates across both `control` and `treatment` test groups. 
3. **JSON Output Generation:** The exact JSON schema requested is populated and output to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.
4. **Validation:** A distinct code cell at the bottom of the notebook guarantees the structural integrity of your aggregated outputs with exact math checks using Python's `assert`.

The notebook expects no external APIs and will execute entirely from top to bottom.
