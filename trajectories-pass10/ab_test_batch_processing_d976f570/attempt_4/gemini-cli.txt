I will generate the requested Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` with the logic for batch processing, aggregations, validations, and summary generation.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been structured to:
1. Iterate over your CSV files and use `try...except` to safely process them, verifying column schemas.
2. Calculate user impressions, conversions, and conversion rates for both control and treatment groups.
3. Export the final results securely to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json` matching the exact JSON structure requested.
4. Conclude with an assertion/validation cell that tests whether conversion counts and file processing metrics match.

The notebook is fully self-contained, does not rely on external APIs, and can be cleanly run sequentially from start to finish.
