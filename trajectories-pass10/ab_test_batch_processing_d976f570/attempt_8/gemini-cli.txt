I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the required cells to handle the data processing, aggregation, output generation, and validation for your A/B test data.

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook with the specified logic for processing your A/B test data. 

The notebook handles potential parsing errors, calculates exactly the aggregate metrics you require (`impressions`, `conversions`, `conversion_rate`), writes the final outputs specifically to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`, and contains an execution cell at the end with assertions to validate everything matches perfectly.

The notebook is saved at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` and is ready for you to execute from top to bottom.
