I will create the Jupyter Notebook file with the requested batch processing, aggregation, error handling, validation, and JSON output logic.

I have created the Jupyter notebook with all of your requirements. It is located at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

The notebook features:
1. **Batch Processing & Error Handling:** Iterates through `campaign_day_*.csv`, wrapped in `try...except` to catch malformed files or missing columns, printing the progress along the way.
2. **Data Aggregation:** Calculates total impressions (`count`), conversions (`sum`), and conversion rate for both the `control` and `treatment` groups.
3. **Validation Cells:** Includes a final block with `assert` statements ensuring that all matched files are accounted for (processed + failed) and that aggregated conversions match the combined raw data.
4. **JSON Export:** Adheres strictly to your JSON structure requirement, saving the compiled dictionary to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`. 

You can run this notebook cleanly from top to bottom.
