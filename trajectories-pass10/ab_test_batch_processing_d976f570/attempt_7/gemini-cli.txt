I will write the Jupyter notebook to the requested path `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` to handle data extraction, aggregation, validation, and output generation.
I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

The notebook includes cells that systematically iterate over your daily data files, employ `try...except` to safeguard against incorrectly formatted CSV files, aggregates metrics for both 'control' and 'treatment' groups, and finally writes out the requested JSON format to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`. It also includes the validation `assert` statements you specified in a dedicated final cell to ensure data consistency during execution.
