I will now create the Jupyter notebook with all the requested logic, including parsing, aggregation, error handling, validation assertions, and JSON summary output.

I have created the Jupyter notebook with all the requested logic. You can find it at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

The notebook handles batch processing, catches parsing exceptions, performs all the data aggregation, saves the expected JSON payload to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`, and includes the final assertion cells for validation without relying on any external APIs. You can run it sequentially from top to bottom.
