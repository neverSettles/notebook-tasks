I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the specified data loading, aggregation, and validation steps. 

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook. It handles file parsing securely using `try...except` blocks, aggregates the data appropriately, generates the requested JSON output, and performs the validation steps you specified. 

The notebook is ready to be run at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`.
