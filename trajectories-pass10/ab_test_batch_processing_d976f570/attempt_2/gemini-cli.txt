I will create the Jupyter notebook with the required batch processing, error handling, aggregation, validation, and JSON export logic.

I have created the Jupyter notebook `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` as requested. 

The notebook has been structured to execute cleanly from top to bottom and includes:
1. **Batch Processing:** Uses `glob` to iterate over all `campaign_day_*.csv` files, and `pandas` to read them, with `try...except` blocks that validate both parsing integrity and required column schemas.
2. **Aggregation:** Computes impressions, conversions, and conversion rates across the successful, combined data.
3. **Output Generation:** Properly formats the metrics into the requested JSON specification and saves it to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.
4. **Validation Cell:** Features `assert` statements at the very end to prove that both the file counts and the total aggregated conversions mathematically match the raw dataframe logic.
