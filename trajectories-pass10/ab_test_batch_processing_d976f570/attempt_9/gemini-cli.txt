I will create the Jupyter notebook with the specified batch processing, aggregation, validation, and JSON output generation.

I have created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` as requested. 

It handles the batch processing of your daily `.csv` files using `pandas`, catches processing exceptions, aggregates the required metrics (impressions, conversions, conversion_rate) for both groups, runs validation checks via `assert` statements, and securely outputs the final formatted JSON to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`. The notebook can be executed sequentially from top to bottom.
