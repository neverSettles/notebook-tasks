I have successfully created and verified the data cleaning pipeline Jupyter notebook as requested.

Here is what was accomplished:
1. **Created Notebook**: A fully structured Jupyter notebook was generated at `/home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb` containing separate code and markdown cells documenting each stage.
2. **Data Loading**: Loaded `store_data.csv`, `region_data.json`, and `product_data.xlsx` using Pandas.
3. **Data Merging**: Performed an inner join across all three dataframes on `store_id`.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Sorted the resulting dataframe by `store_id` in ascending order.
5. **Data Export**: Saved the final merged and sorted data to `/home/user/ml_training_data.csv` without the pandas index.
6. **Execution**: I ran the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb` to verify its correctness, and it successfully generated the merged CSV dataset.
