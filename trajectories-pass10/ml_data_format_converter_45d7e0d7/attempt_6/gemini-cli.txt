I will write the Jupyter Notebook for the ML training data pipeline and then execute it to ensure it successfully generates the expected CSV.
I will execute the notebook to verify it successfully runs without errors and produces the merged ML training CSV.
I will write a Python script to safely construct and save the Jupyter Notebook. This avoids any JSON formatting errors.
I'll now test the newly generated notebook to ensure it executes without errors and generates the final CSV file correctly.
I will quickly verify if the resulting `/home/user/ml_training_data.csv` was successfully produced from the notebook execution.
I have successfully created and tested the requested data pipeline Jupyter notebook.

The notebook, located at `/home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb`, has been constructed cleanly using separate cells for each step of the pipeline:

1.  **Data Loading:** Imports `pandas` and reads the three separate input files (CSV, JSON, and Excel).
2.  **Data Merging:** Performs an inner join across all three dataframes via `store_id`.
3.  **Data Cleaning:** Sorts the resulting dataframe by `store_id` in ascending order.
4.  **Export:** Saves the final merged and cleaned dataset into `/home/user/ml_training_data.csv` while omitting the index.

I verified its execution using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb`, and the merged output was successfully generated.
