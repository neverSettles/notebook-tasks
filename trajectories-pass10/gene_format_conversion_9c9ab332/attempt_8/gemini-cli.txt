I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the specified cells for loading, standardizing column names, filtering, and exporting the data, and then run it to ensure it executes without errors.

I'll now test the newly created notebook to verify it executes successfully and can process the data as requested.

I'll generate the notebook programmatically using Python to ensure the JSON formatting is completely valid, as there was a syntax issue with the manually structured file.

I will write a Python script that will dynamically generate the JSON format for the Jupyter Notebook, avoiding any text escaping issues, and then I will execute it.

I will now execute the python script to generate the actual Notebook file accurately.

I will update the script with proper escaped newlines so that the Python syntax is valid, and then recreate the notebook.

I will run the updated Python script to create the `.ipynb` file correctly, followed by executing it with `jupyter nbconvert`.

I will fix the literal string formatting in the generation script. Newlines were incorrectly escaped as literal text rather than true line breaks in the JSON format.

I will execute the script once again to create the proper `.ipynb` format, then test the notebook to ensure the entire flow runs perfectly.

I'll quickly verify that the generated output files (the JSON and Excel files) have been created successfully.

I'll quickly tidy up the workspace by removing the temporary python script used to generate the notebook.

The Jupyter Notebook `/home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb` has been successfully generated and executed. It fulfills all your requirements:

1. **Loads the Data:** Reads from `/home/user/raw_genes.csv`.
2. **Standardizes Columns:** Converts all names to lowercase and replaces spaces/hyphens with underscores (e.g., `Gene ID` -> `gene_id`, etc.).
3. **Filters Data:** Removes any rows where `expression_level` is strictly less than `10.0` (keeps `>= 10.0`).
4. **Format Conversion & Export:** Saves the cleaned dataset to `/home/user/clean_genes.json` (`orient='records'`) and `/home/user/clean_genes.xlsx` (`index=False`). 

The notebook has been successfully verified to run completely error-free using `jupyter nbconvert`.
