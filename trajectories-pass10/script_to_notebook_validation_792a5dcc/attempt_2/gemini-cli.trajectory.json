This script generates simulated sales data, applies discounts, calculates a summary by category, and outputs a CSV.\n\nPlease convert this script into a properly structured Jupyter Notebook named `/home/user/production_sales_analysis.ipynb`.\n\nThe notebook must meet the following requirements:\n1. It must be executable from top to bottom (`jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/production_sales_analysis.ipynb`).\n2. Include Markdown cells:\n   - A title cell at the top (e.g., `# Sales Analysis Production`).\n   - A Markdown cell explaining the data generation step.\n   - A Markdown cell before the validation step.\n3. Code Structure:\n   - Cell(s) for imports and data generation/loading.\n   - Cell(s) for the core computation (`discounted_price` and grouping).\n4. Validation (Crucial!): Add a new code cell dedicated to testing the correctness of the results using `assert` statements. You must assert:\n   - The total number of rows in the raw data `df` is exactly 100.\n   - The minimum `discounted_price` in `df` is greater than or equal to 0.\n   - The sum of `discounted_price` in the grouped `summary` dataframe is exactly equal to the sum of `discounted_price` in the raw `df` dataframe (use `np.isclose` or `round` to handle floating point precision).\n5. Output: The final code cell must export the `summary` dataframe to `/home/user/final_sales_summary.csv` (without the index), exactly as the original script did.\n\nDo not alter the random seed (`np.random.seed(42)`) or the data generation logic from the original script, as the output values must remain deterministic."

Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",
