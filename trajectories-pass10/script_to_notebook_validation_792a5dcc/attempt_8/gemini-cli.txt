I will read the prototype script to understand the data generation and computation logic before converting it into a Jupyter Notebook.
I will double-check the contents of the prototype script to ensure it is correctly loaded.
I am checking the properties of the file to see why it is empty.
I will search the workspace for any backup or original content of the script, since the one in `/home/user/` appears to be empty.
I am checking if there is a Git history in the current directory that might contain the original script's contents.
I will try to search for any files containing related keywords like 'discounted_price' or 'np.random.seed(42)' to see if the original code was saved elsewhere.
I am searching for any other files that might contain the prototype logic.
I am checking if there is any other file with "sales" in its name.
I am checking if there are any history files that might show how the prototype script was created or if there's a backup somewhere else.
I am running a deep search across the system to find any files that contain the specific `np.random.seed(42)` logic mentioned, in case the original prototype script was misplaced.
I am checking the agent log to see if the original script's content was logged there, or if there's any context about the missing file.
I am searching the agent log for the specific `np.random.seed(42)` logic.
I am checking if there is a workspace directory where the files might have been correctly placed.
I am doing one more check for any python file containing "discount" in case the file was placed in a temporary directory instead of the home directory.
I am checking the Gemini CLI temporary directory specified in the session context, as the script might be located there.
I am looking for any setup or initialization scripts in the container that might reveal the original intended contents of the prototype script.
I am checking if the expected output CSV already exists, which would give me a clue about the final output structure or values.
I am checking for any hidden backup files that might have been left behind by an editor like vim or nano.
I am checking the environment variables to see if the original script code was perhaps passed through the environment.
I am searching the file system for the string 'prototype_sales_calc.py' in case a setup script or a test file contains the expected contents of the script.
