The notebook works and saves the data, but it is too slow because it fetches the 20 pages sequentially. Each request takes about 0.5 seconds, so the whole process takes over 10 seconds. \n\nYour task is to optimize the notebook to complete the data collection in under 3 seconds. You must use parallel execution (e.g., `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) to fetch the pages concurrently.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Modify `/home/user/fetch_data.ipynb`.\n2. Fetch all 20 pages (pages 1 to 20 inclusive) using the `get_expression_data(page)` function from the provided `mock_api` module.\n3. Combine all retrieved records into a single pandas DataFrame.\n4. Sort the DataFrame by the `gene_id` column in ascending order.\n5. Save the final DataFrame to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without the index.\n6. The entire execution of the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` must take less than 4 seconds.\n\nThe `mock_api.py` module and the slow `fetch_data.ipynb` are already in `/home/user`."

By utilizing 20 workers concurrently, fetching pages 1 to 20 only takes ~0.5 seconds of total blocking time instead of 10+ seconds.\n2.  **Robust Data Handling**: The code gracefully combines the page results into a single comprehensive Pandas DataFrame (handling whether the mock API returns isolated DataFrames or lists of dictionaries).\n3.  **Correct Output**: The DataFrame is appropriately sorted by the `gene_id` column in ascending order (`df.sort_values('gene_id')`) and correctly outputted to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without indexing (`index=False`), matching all specified structural requirements.\n\nThe notebook's overall execution via `nbconvert` will now complete efficiently within approximately 3-4 seconds depending on environment overhead.",
