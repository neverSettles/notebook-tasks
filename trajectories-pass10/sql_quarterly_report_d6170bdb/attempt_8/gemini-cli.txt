I have created and executed the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` which successfully follows all of your requirements. 

Here is a summary of the steps completed by the notebook:
1. **Load Data**: Read the sales data from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
2. **Database Setup**: Created a SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db` and inserted the data into a `sales` table.
3. **SQL Reporting**: Ran a query using `pandas.read_sql` to calculate total revenue grouped by `region` in alphabetical order.
4. **Export Data**: The results were exported to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` without an index.
5. **Visualization**: A bar chart of total revenue by region was generated and saved to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

The generated outputs and the executed notebook are all available in your workspace.
