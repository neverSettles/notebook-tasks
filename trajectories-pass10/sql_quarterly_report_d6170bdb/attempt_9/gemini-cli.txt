I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter Notebook as requested.

Here is a summary of the steps completed:
1. **Created the Notebook**: Generated the notebook at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` using `nbformat`. It includes the python code to complete all the tasks.
2. **Execution**: Ran `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`.
3. **Outputs Generated**:
   - `sales.db`: Created the SQLite database and loaded the DataFrame into the `sales` table.
   - `revenue_report.csv`: Queried the total revenue grouped by `region`, ordered alphabetically, and saved it to this CSV file without the index.
   - `revenue_plot.png`: Created and saved a bar chart of the total revenue by region using `matplotlib`.
