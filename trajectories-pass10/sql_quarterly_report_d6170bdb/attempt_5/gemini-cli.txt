The quarterly performance report notebook has been created and executed successfully. 

Here is what was done:
1. **Jupyter Notebook Created:** The file `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` was generated containing all the necessary steps using Python and Pandas.
2. **Notebook Executed:** The notebook was run to produce the required outputs.
   - It successfully read from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
   - A SQLite database was created at `/home/user/sales.db` loading the data into a `sales` table.
   - The requested SQL grouping query was performed.
   - The summarized data was exported to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` formatted exactly as requested (`region` and `total_revenue` columns).
   - The bar chart was successfully plotted and saved as `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

All generated files are now available in your `/home/user/` directory.
