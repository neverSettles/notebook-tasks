I will create the Jupyter notebook that performs the data loading, database setup, SQL reporting, CSV export, and plotting tasks, and then I will execute it.
I am now executing the notebook to process the data, perform the database queries, and generate the output files.
I will inspect the created notebook to resolve the JSON formatting error.
I will use a Python script to safely generate the JSON file for the notebook to prevent further formatting errors, and then execute it again.
I will run the generator script and then execute the created Jupyter notebook.
I will adjust the Python script to use multi-line strings, avoiding escape sequence issues, and re-execute.
I will now execute the generation script and run the notebook.
I will verify that all requested output files were successfully created.
I will double-check the exported CSV to ensure it formatted correctly without an index and with the correct column names.
I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter Notebook for your quarterly performance report.

Here is a summary of what was accomplished:
1. **Created Notebook**: A Jupyter Notebook was generated at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`.
2. **Loaded Data & Database Setup**: The notebook reads `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` and loads it into a new SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db` under the `sales` table.
3. **SQL Query & Export**: A SQL query was run to aggregate revenue by region and order it alphabetically. The results were exported without an index to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` with the exact columns `region` and `total_revenue`.
4. **Data Visualization**: A bar chart visualizing the revenue per region was successfully generated and saved to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.
5. **Executed Notebook**: The notebook was executed directly using `jupyter nbconvert`, processing all of the steps and generating the necessary output files. 

All your final files are now ready in the `/home/user/` directory! Let me know if you need any further adjustments.
