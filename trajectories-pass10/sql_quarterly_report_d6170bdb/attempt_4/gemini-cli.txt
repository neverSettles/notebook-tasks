I will inspect the `raw_sales.csv` file to understand the column names before writing the Jupyter notebook.
I will write the Jupyter Notebook file with the requested data analysis code and then execute it.
I will now execute the Jupyter Notebook to process the data, generate the SQLite database, produce the CSV report, and save the bar chart.
I will fix the notebook file structure and execute it.
I'll quickly check that all the required output files were correctly generated.
I'll also verify the contents of the generated report file.
I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter Notebook to process the sales data. 

Here is what was accomplished:
1. **Loaded Data:** Read the data from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
2. **Database Setup:** Created a SQLite database (`/home/user/sales.db`) and imported the data into a `sales` table.
3. **SQL Reporting:** Executed the required `read_sql` query to calculate the total revenue grouped by `region` in alphabetical order.
4. **Export Data:** Saved the aggregated results to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv`.
5. **Visualization:** Generated a bar chart of the revenue by region and saved it to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

The notebook itself has also been successfully saved and executed at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`. Let me know if you need any additional adjustments!
