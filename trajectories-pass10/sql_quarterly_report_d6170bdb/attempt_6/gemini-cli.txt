I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter Notebook to process the sales data and generate the quarterly performance report.

Here is a summary of the steps completed:
1. **Loaded Data**: Created a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` that reads `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
2. **Database Setup**: The data was loaded into a newly created SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db` in a table named `sales`.
3. **SQL Reporting**: Executed a SQL query using `pandas.read_sql` to group and calculate the total revenue by region in alphabetical order.
4. **Export Data**: Saved the queried data to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` with exactly the `region` and `total_revenue` columns, without the index. 
5. **Visualization**: A bar chart visualizing the regional revenue was created and saved as `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

The notebook has been fully executed, and you can view the output files (`quarterly_report.ipynb`, `sales.db`, `revenue_report.csv`, and `revenue_plot.png`) in the `/home/user/` directory.
