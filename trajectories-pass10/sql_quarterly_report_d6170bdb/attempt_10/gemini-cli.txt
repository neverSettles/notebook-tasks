I have created and executed the Jupyter Notebook as requested.

The notebook, `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`, performs the complete data processing pipeline:
1. **Load Data:** Reads the data from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
2. **Database Setup:** Creates a SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db` and writes the data into a `sales` table.
3. **SQL Reporting:** Uses a `pandas.read_sql` query (`SELECT region, SUM(revenue) as total_revenue FROM sales GROUP BY region ORDER BY region ASC;`) to calculate the total revenue. 
4. **Export Data:** Saves the resulting dataset with columns `region` and `total_revenue` to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv`.
5. **Visualization:** Generates a bar chart and successfully saves it to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

The notebook was successfully executed in the environment, and all output files (`sales.db`, `revenue_report.csv`, and `revenue_plot.png`) are now available in your directory.
