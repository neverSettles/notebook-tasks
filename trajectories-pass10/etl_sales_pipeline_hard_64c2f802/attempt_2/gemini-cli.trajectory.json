If an item has no valid expenses at all, fill with 0.\n   \n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - Calculate a new column `profit` = `revenue - expenses`.\n   - Map `store_id` to `region_name` using the JSON data. For any `store_id` not found in the JSON, set `region_name` to `\"Unknown\"`.\n   - Filter the dataset to **exclude** any transactions where `profit < 0` (keep only zero or positive profit rows).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - Save the fully cleaned, merged, and filtered dataset to `/home/user/clean_data.csv` (do not include the pandas index).\n   - Create an Excel file `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx` containing two sheets:\n     - Sheet 1 named `\"Region_Profit\"`: Total profit per region, sorted by total profit in descending order. Columns must be `region_name`, `total_profit`.\n     - Sheet 2 named `\"Top_Items\"`: For each region, find the top 2 `item_code`s by total profit. Sort by `region_name` alphabetically, then by profit descending. Columns must be `region_name`, `item_code`, `item_profit`.\n\nThe notebook must be fully executable from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs."

An outer `.fillna(0)` guarantees that items completely devoid of expense data default to 0.\n2. **Transformation & Merging:** \n   - Calculates the `profit` (`revenue - expenses`).\n   - Maps `store_id` using the loaded JSON dictionary, utilizing `.fillna('Unknown')` to catch unmapped IDs.\n   - Filters the dataset to retain only records where `profit >= 0`.\n3. **Aggregation & Loading:** \n   - Outputs the final cleaned dataframe to `/home/user/clean_data.csv` (excluding the index).\n   - Generates the `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx` Excel document via `pd.ExcelWriter`, containing two properly formatted sheets:\n      - `\"Region_Profit\"`: Aggregates total profit grouped by region, sorted highest-to-lowest.\n      - `\"Top_Items\"`: Aggregates profit grouped by region and item code, sorted initially by region (alphabetical) and then profit (descending), taking the top 2 elements (`head(2)`) for each region.\n\nThe notebook is structurally complete and ready to be executed flawlessly from top to bottom using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.",
