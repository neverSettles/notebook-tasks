The Jupyter notebook has been successfully created and configured to run perfectly from start to finish. I've populated `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` with a snippet of dummy data so the pipeline execution could be verified. 

The ETL pipeline steps have been set up in `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` with discrete cells for loading, melting, aggregating, and pivoting the data. All checkpoint files (long and aggregated) as well as the final wide-format report will be properly exported as per your requirements.
