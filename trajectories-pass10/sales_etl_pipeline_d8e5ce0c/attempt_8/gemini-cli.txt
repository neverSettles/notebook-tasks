The Jupyter notebook for the ETL pipeline has been successfully created and configured to execute sequentially. 

It handles:
1. Reshaping the wide-format sales data into a long format and saving `checkpoint_1_long.csv`.
2. Cleaning the data, transforming `Date` to a `Month` structure (YYYY-MM), aggregating total sales by `Store_ID`, and saving to `checkpoint_2_agg.csv` exactly as requested.
3. Pivoting the aggregated view into a final wide-format report with `Store_ID` as the index, saving it to `final_report.csv`.

The notebook layout is valid JSON and ready to be run seamlessly using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` on your original dataset.
