It contains daily sales in a wide format with dates as columns.\n\nThe notebook should have distinct cells for each step of the pipeline and output specific checkpoint files so we can audit the transformations.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Load the raw data from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\n2. **Step 1 (Melt)**: Reshape the data from wide to long format. The identifier variables should be `Store_ID` and `Region`. The variable column should be named `Date` and the value column should be named `Sales`. Fill any missing `Sales` values with 0. Save this intermediate dataframe to `/home/user/checkpoint_1_long.csv` (without the index).\n3. **Step 2 (Clean & Aggregate)**: Convert the `Date` column to datetime. Extract the year-month string (format: 'YYYY-MM') into a new column called `Month`. Then, aggregate the total sales by `Store_ID` and `Month`. Save this aggregated dataframe to `/home/user/checkpoint_2_agg.csv` (without the index). The columns should be exactly `Store_ID`, `Month`, and `Total_Sales`.\n4. **Step 3 (Pivot)**: Pivot the aggregated data back into a clean wide format for a final report. The index should be `Store_ID`, the columns should be the unique `Month` values, and the values should be the `Total_Sales`. Save this final dataframe to `/home/user/final_report.csv` (keeping the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook runs perfectly from start to finish with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`."

Missing sales values are filled with `0`, and the intermediate DataFrame is saved to `checkpoint_1_long.csv` (without the index).\n- **Step 2 (Clean & Aggregate):** The `Date` column is converted to datetime objects to extract the `Month` string (in `YYYY-MM` format). Total sales are aggregated by `Store_ID` and `Month` and saved to `checkpoint_2_agg.csv` containing exactly the requested columns: `Store_ID`, `Month`, and `Total_Sales` (without the index).\n- **Step 3 (Pivot):** The data is pivoted back into a wide-format final report indexing by `Store_ID`, allocating columns by unique `Month` values, and filling them with `Total_Sales`. This is saved to `final_report.csv` (keeping the index).\n\nThe notebook successfully runs end-to-end via `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.",
