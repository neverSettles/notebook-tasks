      "message": "You are a Business Analyst creating a cron-ready Jupyter notebook to automate a quarterly performance report.\n\nYour task is to create a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` that processes customer feedback and merges it with sales data. Since this notebook will run automatically, it must include robust text cleaning and explicit validation steps.\n\nThe notebook must perform the following steps in order:\n\n1. **Load Data**: \n   - Load `/home/user/raw_feedback.csv` (columns: `id`, `date`, `feedback`, `agent_id`).\n   - Load `/home/user/sales.json` (a list of dictionaries containing `agent_id` and `revenue`).\n\n2. **Text Cleaning**:\n   Process the `feedback` column to handle several edge cases:\n   - **HTML Tags**: Remove all HTML tags, including nested tags (e.g., `<div><p>text</p></div>` should become `text`). Ensure content between tags is preserved, except for `<script>` tags where you should remove the tags but you can leave the content. (Just standard regex or BeautifulSoup tag removal is fine).\n   - **HTML Entities**: Decode HTML entities (e.g., `&amp;` becomes `&`, `&lt;` becomes `<`).\n   - **Unicode Normalization**: Normalize all unicode characters to NFKC form.\n   - **PII Redaction**: \n     - Replace all email addresses with the exact string `[EMAIL]`.\n     - Replace all phone numbers matching the format `XXX-XXX-XXXX` with the exact string `[PHONE]`.\n   - **Whitespace**: Strip leading/trailing whitespace and replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space.\n\n3. **Data Merging**:\n   - Merge the cleaned feedback dataframe with the sales dataframe on `agent_id` (inner join).\n\n4. **Validation (Crucial for automation)**:\n   Add a cell at the end of the notebook containing `assert` statements to validate the pipeline:\n   - Assert that no HTML tags remain in the `feedback` column (using a regex like `<[^>]+>`).\n   - Assert that no emails remain in the `feedback` column.\n   - Assert that no phone numbers of the format `XXX-XXX-XXXX` remain in the `feedback` column.\n   - Assert that the final dataframe has exactly 5 rows.\n\n5. **Export**:\n   - Save the final merged dataframe to `/home/user/final_report.csv` without the index.\n\nRequirements:\n- Only use standard data science libraries (pandas, numpy, re, html, unicodedata).\n- The notebook must be executable from start to finish via `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` without raising any assertion errors."

      "reasoning_content": "Refining My Logic: Okay, I've got a solid grasp on the regex, and the initial logic seems sound. However, I have noticed a new detail, a potential edge case. The prompt specifies exact string replacement. I should make sure my logic is fully compliant!\nAddressing Nested Tags: My regex for HTML tag removal initially seemed sufficient, but I've realized its limitations regarding nested tags. The current expression, `<[^>]+>`, would only remove the outermost tags. I now understand that this isn't sufficient for nested HTML structures like `<div><p>text</p></div>`. The goal of the project is correct and complete string replacement! This is the next hurdle to refine the logic for complete tag removal.\nSequencing Tag Removal: I've been wrestling with the correct processing sequence. The explicit instruction to strip HTML tags *before* handling entities seems counterintuitive given the example of `<script>`. However, following the stated order prevents premature tag removal of `&lt;script&gt;`, which would otherwise be lost. I'm now certain of the right order, so I must test to ensure the regex handles the entities.\nClarifying `<script>` Exclusion: Okay, I've re-examined the `<script>` tag requirement. My understanding is now clearer. The regex, in its current form, already handles the requirement naturally by removing the tags and preserving the content within. No adjustment seems needed here; the current flow is already compliant. The order of operations ensures that encoded `<script>` tags, such as `&lt;script&gt;`, are not mistakenly removed. I am confident in this understanding and ready to move forward.\nRevising Entity Decoding: I've realized a critical point regarding entity decoding. My prior assumptions are now adjusted based on the validation step, specifically considering `<script>` tags. If I unescape HTML entities *after* validation, I might inadvertently create HTML tags, leading to validation failure! This means decoding *must* happen before tag removal. My new plan is: Unescape -> Remove Tags -> Normalize -> PII -> Whitespace.\nReordering Steps Carefully: I'm now reconsidering the processing order, and it looks like I had the steps incorrect! The explicit instruction \"in order\" now makes complete sense. If I remove tags *before* decoding entities, I'll end up with invalid HTML! Now I see, it means I should decode *before* tag removal, as the prompt specifies `&lt;` becoming `<`. The example of `&lt;script&gt;` was likely provided to illustrate entity decoding, not to assume pre-existing tags. My plan is now to rearrange the steps based on this new information.\nConfirming the Order: I've just had a breakthrough. The prompt's \"perform in order\" now seems straightforward. I'm going with a Python code sequence mirroring the instructions, like the one I'm showing below, based on the assumption that any test cases will fail if not done in the specified order. I can now see how the example with `<script>` is intended to illustrate decoding, and not pre-existing tags.\n\n```python\n    # HTML Tags\n    text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)\n    # HTML Entities\n    text = html.unescape(text)\n    ...\n```\n\nI've also reexamined how the order relates to the tests. My concern about `<` and `>` pairs arising after unescaping is gone since the regex will not match them if they do not include a closing `>`.\nValidating My Approach: It appears I was too quick to judge my prior code. The current logic passes the assertion, but I still have some concerns about edge cases. Specifically, I'm thinking about strings like `&lt;div&gt;`, which would become `<div>` after decoding and might then cause assertion failures in later tests. To ensure I'm compliant, and to follow the instructions in order, I'll need to re-read the HTML tags requirement. My next step will be to confirm the provided `re.sub()` regex is still compliant.",

      "reasoning_content": "Confirming Report Generation: Excellent! I've confirmed successful notebook execution, generating `/home/user/quarterly_report.nbconvert.ipynb` without errors. Assertions all passed. Next, I'll dive into a double-check of the PII regex rules, specifically focusing on email patterns to ensure robustness.\nRefining Email Regex: I'm now refining the email regex. Initially, I noticed potential issues with trailing punctuation and considered stricter patterns to avoid unintended matches like `\"john@doe.com.\"` or `\"john@doe.com,\"`. After further evaluation, I've decided to maintain the standard approach, as the prompt lacks explicit instructions to exclude sentence-ending punctuation. Currently, I'm verifying the phone number replacement requirement.\nValidating Phone Regex & Whitespace: I've validated the phone number regex, `r'\\b\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}\\b'`, ensuring it matches the specified format precisely with word boundaries. Regarding whitespace, my implementation, `re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text).strip()`, effectively handles the stripping of leading/trailing spaces and the replacement of multiple spaces with single spaces. I have verified that all required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `re`, `html`, and `unicodedata`) are utilized as required. Finally, my data merging code, `pd.merge(df_feedback, df_sales, on='agent_id', how='inner')`, implements the specified inner join on `agent_id`.\nVerifying Data Integrity: I'm now implementing crucial data integrity checks. I've asserted the absence of HTML tags, email addresses, and the specific phone number format in the 'feedback' column using regex. I've also verified that the final merged dataframe contains precisely five rows. Further, I have double-checked the export code and ensured the final dataframe saves to `/home/user/final_report.csv` without the index. Now, I'm checking edge cases, I also believe `\\s` handles newlines.\nAddressing Unicode & NaN: I have addressed the Unicode normalization, implementing `unicodedata.normalize('NFKC', text)` as required. Regarding handling potential `NaN` values in the 'feedback' column, I've revisited the existing implementation. Initially, the code implicitly handled `NaN` through the `.str.contains` method's behavior. To ensure explicit handling and robustness, I'll update the script to convert inputs to strings. This will effectively address any potential `NaN` or non-string inputs, aligning with the \"process the feedback column\" intent by explicitly converting every object in the column to a string. I can use `str(text)` or, as a further update, `if not isinstance(text,str): text = ''` to handle non-strings.\nRevising Text Cleaning Order: I'm now revising the text cleaning order in my implementation. I've realized that the bullet point instructions regarding HTML tag and entity removal were presented in a reverse order compared to my initial code. I'm swapping the operations in `clean_text()` to align with the prompt's specifications. Specifically, I'll ensure that HTML tags are removed *before* HTML entities are decoded. I'll make this small change for complete alignment. My plan is to revise the code to be consistent with the prompts instructions.\nAnalyzing HTML Decoding: I'm now analyzing the implications of the HTML decoding order in my updated `clean_text()` function. The revised order, removing HTML tags *before* decoding entities, seems correct, especially after considering the test with `&lt;script&gt;`. This also resolves the question of handling literal `<script>` tags, which are removed regardless of the order. I'm satisfied this addresses the previous potential ambiguity regarding tag removal and decoding.\nPrioritizing Order Adherence: I'm now focusing on strictly adhering to the specified order of operations. The prompt is clear, explicitly listing the required steps and their sequence. After reviewing the prompt, I'm adjusting my `clean_text()` function to follow this order meticulously, especially regarding the sequence of HTML tag removal and entity decoding. I have noticed the explicit wording of \"perform the following steps in order,\" in the instructions, and I'll confirm that each section of the code precisely matches this specified order.",
