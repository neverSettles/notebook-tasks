Load `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. Create an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`) and write the DataFrame to a table named `sales`.\n4.

Use the `RANK()` window function.\n5. Save the result of this query to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index. \nThe output CSV must contain exactly three columns named: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.\n\nEnsure your notebook executes cleanly from top to bottom.

      "reasoning_content": "Initiating ETL Pipeline: I am starting to understand the objective. My focus is on constructing a Jupyter Notebook file, specifically located at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`, to serve as an ETL pipeline. I have identified the necessary libraries: pandas and sqlite3, and I now know to load the file `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\nRefining the SQL Query: Now, I'm modifying the pipeline. I've switched gears and am focusing on building out the SQL query. I am now calculating total revenue per region and ranking regions by their revenue. The data needs to be stored in the in-memory SQLite database as I generate the file `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`. I must ensure this executes cleanly with these output columns: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.\nFinalizing the Pipeline Script: I've completed constructing the `.ipynb` file. The file is structured with cells for importing libraries, reading the raw CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame, connecting to an in-memory SQLite database, and writing to the database. A SQL query calculates total revenue by region and assigns a sales rank. The final DataFrame is saved to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`. I'm confident that this covers the objective.\nExecuting the Query: I am now executing the SQL query to generate the ranked revenue data. The total revenue for each region is being calculated, and a rank is assigned based on the revenue. I am using `pd.read_sql_query` to load this into a DataFrame. The final output is then written to the designated `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` file.\nValidating the Implementation: Now, I'm verifying the code's compliance with all stated requirements. I've ensured I import the necessary libraries and load the correct CSV. An in-memory SQLite database is used for the query, correctly computing the total revenue and applying the rank. I've confirmed that the output CSV includes the specified columns. I will now create the JSON and save it. I'll use a single cell for the notebook to simplify the notebook's structure.\nConfirming File Content: The code is now implemented to ensure the correct information will be written to the output file. Specifically, I'm checking that necessary packages are imported, that I'm reading in the raw sales data to create the `sales` table, and using SQL to calculate `total_revenue` and `sales_rank` by region. This is all implemented. I'm satisfied.",
