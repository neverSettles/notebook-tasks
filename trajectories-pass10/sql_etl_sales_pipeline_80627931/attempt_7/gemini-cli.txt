I will create the requested Jupyter Notebook with the ETL pipeline steps.

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. 

It contains a single code cell that:
1. Imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`.
2. Reads `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Creates an in-memory SQLite database and loads the data into the `sales` table.
4. Executes the requested SQL query (using `SUM(amount)` and the `RANK()` window function) to generate `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.
5. Saves the final result to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` with `index=False`.

The notebook is structurally valid (`.ipynb` JSON format) and ready to be executed cleanly from top to bottom by the automated tests.
