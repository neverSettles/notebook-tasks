I have created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that perfectly fulfills all the requirements. 

It imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`, loads the `raw_sales.csv` data into an in-memory SQLite database, computes the total revenue and ranking per region using the `RANK()` window function, and seamlessly exports the aggregated results to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the DataFrame index.
