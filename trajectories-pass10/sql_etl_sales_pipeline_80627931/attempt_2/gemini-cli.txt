I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the ETL pipeline to read the raw data, process it in an in-memory SQLite database, and export the clean data as requested.

I will now run the automated tests against the notebook to make sure it executes cleanly and generates the expected output.

I am going to use Python to properly generate the notebook file to fix the JSON formatting issues.

I will now check the contents of the generated CSV file to ensure it meets your requirements.

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that performs your required ETL steps.

The notebook:
1. Imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`.
2. Reads `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
3. Stores it in a local `:memory:` SQLite table named `sales`.
4. Uses the `RANK()` window function along with `SUM()` to calculate total revenue per region and assigns a rank.
5. Saves the output to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index.

I also verified the notebook by running it headlessly with `jupyter nbconvert`, and it executes correctly from top to bottom, generating the three expected columns (`region`, `total_revenue`, `sales_rank`) successfully.
