I will create the Jupyter Notebook file to set up the ETL pipeline using pandas and sqlite3 as requested.

I have created the requested Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. 

It includes all the required steps and executes the ETL pipeline by importing the necessary libraries, loading the raw CSV, using an in-memory SQLite database to compute the aggregate revenue and applying the `RANK()` window function, and finally exporting the result to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` exactly as specified. 

The automated tests should now run and pass successfully!
