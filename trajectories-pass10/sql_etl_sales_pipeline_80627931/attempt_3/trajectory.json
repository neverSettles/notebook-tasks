I have a raw dataset located at `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\n\nCreate a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that performs the following steps:\n1. Import `pandas` and `sqlite3`.\n2. Load `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. Create an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`) and write the DataFrame to a table named `sales`.\n4. Execute a SQL query that calculates the total revenue (sum of `amount`) per `region`, and assigns a rank to each region based on their total revenue (highest revenue = rank 1). Use the `RANK()` window function.\n5. Save the result of this query to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index. \nThe output CSV must contain exactly three columns named: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.\n\nEnsure your notebook executes cleanly from top to bottom. Automated tests will run your notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` and check the contents of `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`."

      "reasoning_content": "Defining the Notebook's Purpose: I'm now zeroing in on the core objective: crafting a Jupyter Notebook for ETL. The focus is now the process. I am building the pipeline and defining its purpose. It's meant to handle the `raw_sales.csv` file, move it to an in-memory SQLite database, run a particular SQL query and store the result.\nOutlining the ETL Steps: I'm now outlining the ETL steps. I need to get data from `raw_sales.csv` and load it to an in-memory SQLite database, named `sales`. Next, I will execute a SQL query to calculate revenue by region and rank them. Finally, I must save the query result to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` with the specified format. The Jupyter notebook must be correctly formatted as a JSON file.\nImplementing the Code: I've crafted the Python code block to handle the ETL process within a single cell. It loads the `raw_sales.csv` file, sets up an in-memory SQLite database, and executes the SQL query to calculate revenue by region and their rank. The resulting data is then saved to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`. I've also begun to sketch out the Jupyter Notebook's JSON structure for this specific code block, but more structure is needed.\nCoding the SQL Execution: I'm now generating Python code for ETL within the notebook cell. I've imported `sqlite3` and `pandas` and loading `raw_sales.csv`. I'm setting up an in-memory SQLite database connection and inserting DataFrame to the table `sales`. The SQL query to calculate revenue and rank is now complete, and the results are saved to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`.\nFinalizing the JSON Structure: I'm now putting the finishing touches on the JSON structure of the Jupyter Notebook. I've defined the content, language, and metadata. I'm focusing on the notebook's structure and ensuring it adheres to the JSON format. The next step is writing the notebook file to the specified path. I will also make some checks for data edge cases.",
