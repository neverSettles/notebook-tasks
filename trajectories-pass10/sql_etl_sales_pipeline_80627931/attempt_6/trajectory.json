I have a raw dataset located at `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\n\nCreate a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that performs the following steps:\n1. Import `pandas` and `sqlite3`.\n2. Load `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. Create an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`) and write the DataFrame to a table named `sales`.\n4. Execute a SQL query that calculates the total revenue (sum of `amount`) per `region`, and assigns a rank to each region based on their total revenue (highest revenue = rank 1). Use the `RANK()` window function.\n5. Save the result of this query to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index. \nThe output CSV must contain exactly three columns named: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.\n\nEnsure your notebook executes cleanly from top to bottom.

      "message": "Defining the Objective: I'm currently focused on defining the project goals. The user desires an ETL pipeline within a Jupyter Notebook (`/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`). I'm now clarifying the specifics of the data source (`/home/user/raw_sales.csv`), the in-memory SQLite database, and the required SQL query to execute.\nOutlining the ETL Logic: I'm now outlining the steps for the ETL pipeline within the notebook. I've broken down the requirements into clear tasks: loading the CSV, connecting to the in-memory SQLite database, crafting the SQL query for revenue ranking, and saving the results to the specified CSV with the correct columns and no pandas index. I'm focusing on the code and its structure first.\nImplementing the ETL: I've translated the outlined ETL logic into Python code within the Jupyter Notebook. This includes connecting to the in-memory SQLite database and writing the Pandas DataFrame to a table. I've constructed and executed the SQL query for revenue ranking, resulting in a new DataFrame that holds the data with the proper ranking. The code now saves the results to the specified CSV, without the pandas index as requested, and closes the database connection.\nRefining the Python Code: I've tested and refined the Python code within the Jupyter Notebook. I've focused on ensuring the in-memory SQLite database operations function correctly. Specifically, I've confirmed that data is written to the SQLite table, and the SQL query for ranking is constructed and executed as designed. The results are stored into a new Pandas DataFrame, which is then saved to the `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` file, without the Pandas index. I've also verified the database connection closes properly.\nVerifying the Setup: I'm now focusing on verifying the test environment setup. I will create the `etl_pipeline.ipynb` file directly. I am inspecting the `raw_sales.csv` file's columns to ensure that they are as I expect them to be - specifically, if the file contains the expected columns (`amount`, `region`). I'll proceed with this step to be absolutely certain before writing the file.\nAnalyzing the Raw Data: I'm now reading the first few lines of `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` using `head` via `run_shell_command`. Afterward, I'll focus on the actual execution. First, I'll verify the file exists, then write `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. I will then run the test locally `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` to make sure Pandas and Jupyter are installed and the notebook works, as validation. I'll focus on writing the notebook.",
