I have successfully converted the `process_finance.py` script into a clean Jupyter Notebook named `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`.

The notebook strictly follows your requirements:
1. **Cell 1**: Imports `pandas` and loads `stocks.csv`.
2. **Cell 2**: Melts the dataframe into a long format.
3. **Cell 3**: Groups by ticker, calculates the mean price, and saves the output to `avg_prices.csv`.

I have also verified the notebook by executing it via `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`. It runs flawlessly, processes the financial data properly, and successfully outputs `avg_prices.csv`.
