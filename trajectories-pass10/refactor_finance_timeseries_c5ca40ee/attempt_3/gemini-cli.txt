I will first examine the existing Python script to understand the exact data processing logic.
I am converting the script into a Jupyter notebook structure and saving it as `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`.
I will now execute the notebook to verify its functionality and ensure it successfully generates the `avg_prices.csv` file.
I am debugging the JSON formatting issue in the notebook file.
I will re-create the notebook file using Python's JSON module to ensure valid formatting.
I will adjust the data loading to use the relative path `stocks.csv` as requested, before executing the notebook.
I will now execute the notebook again to confirm it runs successfully and generates the output file.
I will verify the newly generated `avg_prices.csv` file has been created and populated correctly.
I'll ensure the final generated notebook contains exactly the three requested code cells and valid code.
The Python script has been successfully converted into a clean Jupyter notebook (`/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`) with exactly three code cells matching your requirements. 

I've executed the notebook, and it successfully processed the time series data, calculating the mean prices correctly and saving the output to `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` without the index. The notebook is formatted as valid JSON and runs perfectly with `jupyter nbconvert`.
