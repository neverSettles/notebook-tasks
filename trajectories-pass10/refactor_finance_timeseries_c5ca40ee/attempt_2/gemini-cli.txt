I'll read the existing Python script to understand the data processing steps before creating the Jupyter notebook.
I will create the Jupyter notebook with the required 3 cells and valid JSON format.
I will now execute the notebook using `nbconvert` to verify it works and generates the final CSV file.
I'll use Python to correctly generate the JSON structure and avoid string escaping issues with the Jupyter notebook format.
I'll run the Jupyter notebook execution command again now that the JSON is well-formed.
I'll check if the output CSV file was successfully generated by the notebook execution.
I have successfully converted your Python script into the requested Jupyter notebook and verified its execution.

The notebook, located at `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`, contains exactly the 3 required cells:
1. Imports `pandas` and loads `stocks.csv`.
2. Melts the DataFrame into a long format structure.
3. Groups the data by `Ticker`, calculates the mean `Price`, and saves the output to `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` (without the index).

I've also run the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` and confirmed that `avg_prices.csv` was generated successfully with the correct average calculations.
