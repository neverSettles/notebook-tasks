I have successfully converted the Python script into the requested Jupyter notebook and verified its execution.

Here is what was accomplished:
1. **Created Notebook:** `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb` was generated as a valid JSON file with exactly 3 code cells containing the logic to import, melt, and group/save the stock data.
2. **Added Metadata:** Ensured appropriate metadata and `id` tags for each cell to prevent any warnings from modern `nbformat` versions. 
3. **Execution & Verification:** Ran `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`, which successfully generated the `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` file without errors.
