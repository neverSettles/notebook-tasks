I have successfully converted the Python script into a Jupyter notebook named `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`. 

The notebook has exactly 3 code cells configured as requested:
1. Imports pandas and loads `stocks.csv`.
2. Melts the DataFrame into a long format.
3. Groups by Ticker to calculate the mean price and saves the output to `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` without the index.

I also executed it using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb` and confirmed that it's a valid JSON notebook and generates the `avg_prices.csv` file without errors.
