I'll read the existing script first to understand the data processing logic.
I will create the Jupyter notebook with the requested three cells containing the corresponding pandas logic.
I will now execute the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to verify it generates the output CSV successfully.
I'll fix the notebook formatting by generating the JSON directly using Python to ensure properly escaped control characters.
I'll use python3 to generate the notebook since python isn't aliased.
I will now re-run the Jupyter notebook execution to generate the output CSV file.
I'll quickly inspect the generated `avg_prices.csv` to ensure the content is correctly formatted.
The Python script has been successfully converted into a cleanly formatted Jupyter notebook (`/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`) meeting all requirements. The notebook contains three designated cells and was properly executed via `jupyter nbconvert`, which processed the data and generated the resulting `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` without an index.
