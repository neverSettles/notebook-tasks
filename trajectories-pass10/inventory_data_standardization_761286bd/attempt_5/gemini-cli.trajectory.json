We have a prototype script, but I want a proper, reproducible notebook that we can run in production.\n\nHere is what you need to do:\n1. Create a notebook at `/home/user/standardize_data.ipynb`.\n2. The notebook should read the file `/home/user/raw_inventory.csv` (which is already provided in the environment).\n3. Standardize the column names: convert them all to lowercase, strip leading/trailing whitespace, and replace spaces with underscores.\n4. Clean the 'product_price' column: It has mixed types (some strings with '$', some missing values like 'N/A' or 'Unknown'). Remove the '$' signs, replace 'N/A' and 'Unknown' with NaN, and convert the column to a float type.\n5. Standardize the 'date_added' column: It has mixed date formats. Parse it to a datetime object, and then format it as a string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. If a date cannot be parsed, it should be a missing value (NaN/NaT).\n6. Ensure the 'item_id' column is of type integer.\n7. Save the cleaned DataFrame to `/home/user/clean_inventory.csv` (do not include the index).\n8. Finally, generate a dictionary mapping the standardized column names to their final string representation of pandas dtypes (e.g., 'float64', 'int64', 'object') and save it as a JSON file at `/home/user/schema_report.json`.\n\nThe notebook must execute successfully from start to finish using `jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook /home/user/standardize_data.ipynb`. Use pandas for all data manipulation."

You can execute it as requested using `jupyter nbconvert`.\n\nThe file is located at: `/home/user/standardize_data.ipynb`\n\n### What the notebook does:\n1. **Reads** the data from `/home/user/raw_inventory.csv`.\n2. **Standardizes** all column names (`lowercase`, `stripped`, and `spaces replaced with underscores`).\n3. **Cleans 'product_price'**: Removes `$` symbols, explicitly converts `N/A` and `Unknown` values to `NaN`, and forces the column to a numeric `float64` format.\n4. **Cleans 'date_added'**: Handles the mixed date formats securely (via `format='mixed'`) before converting them consistently to `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, enforcing missing or unparseable dates as `NaN`.\n5. **Casts 'item_id'**: Explicitly coerces `item_id` to Pandas' nullable integer format (`Int64`), accounting for missing values smoothly.\n6. **Outputs** the cleaned file seamlessly without the index to `/home/user/clean_inventory.csv`.\n7. **Maps and saves** the data dictionary as a JSON file at `/home/user/schema_report.json`.\n\nI ran a test execution to verify that everything works correctly from start to finish.
