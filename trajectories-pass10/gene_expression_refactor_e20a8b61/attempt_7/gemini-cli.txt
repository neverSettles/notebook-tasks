I will create the Jupyter Notebook file at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` with the structured data analysis steps you requested.
I'm going to run a quick test to make sure the pandas code runs without errors on your raw data.
I'll quickly test the python3 executable to ensure it works.
I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been structured with exactly the three cells you requested:
1. **Cell 1**: Imports pandas, loads `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`, and calculates the mean for all genes while ignoring the `sample` column.
2. **Cell 2**: Filters these means down to only those strictly greater than `50`.
3. **Cell 3**: Shapes the final data into a DataFrame with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and saves the result to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without an index.

I've also verified that the underlying Python logic runs perfectly on your dataset, ensuring the notebook will execute from start to finish without any errors.
