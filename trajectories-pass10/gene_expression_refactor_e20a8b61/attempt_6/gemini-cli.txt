I will create the Jupyter notebook with the specified cells to load, filter, and save the gene expression data.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. It is clean, well-commented, and contains the exact cells and logic you requested:

1. **Cell 1:** Imports `pandas`, loads `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`, and calculates the mean expression for each gene while explicitly dropping the `sample` column.
2. **Cell 2:** Filters the means to keep only genes with an expression strictly greater than `50`.
3. **Cell 3:** Structures the result into a DataFrame with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and saves it to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without an index.

The notebook is now ready for you to execute.
