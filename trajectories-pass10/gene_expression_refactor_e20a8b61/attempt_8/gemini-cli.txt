I will create the Jupyter notebook with the specified cells to process your gene expression data.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook for you at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. 

The notebook is fully documented and structured into the three requested cells:
1. **Cell 1** imports `pandas`, loads `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`, drops the `sample` column, and calculates the mean expression of the remaining gene columns.
2. **Cell 2** strictly filters the calculated means for values greater than 50.
3. **Cell 3** structures the results into a new DataFrame with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, saving it directly to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without including the index.

You can now open the notebook and execute it from start to finish without errors!
