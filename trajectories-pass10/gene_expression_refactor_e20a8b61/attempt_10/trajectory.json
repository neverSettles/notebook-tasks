I need you to create a clean, well-documented Jupyter notebook that performs the analysis steps clearly.\n\nThere is a raw dataset located at `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`. \n\nPlease create a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` that does the following:\n\n**Cell 1: Data Loading & Calculation**\n- Import pandas.\n- Load `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`.\n- Calculate the mean expression for each gene (all columns except the `sample` column).\n\n**Cell 2: Filtering**\n- Filter the calculated means to keep ONLY the genes with a mean expression strictly greater than 50.\n\n**Cell 3: Report Generation**\n- Create a DataFrame from the filtered results with exactly two columns: `Gene` and `Mean_Expression`.\n- Save this DataFrame to a CSV file at `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the index (`index=False`).\n\nThe notebook must be executable from start to finish without errors."

      "message": "Initiating the Notebook: I am now focused on initiating the Jupyter Notebook for gene analysis. I am planning the creation of the `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` file and its contents, based on the user's explicit instructions. My primary objective is a notebook with three specific cells, each performing distinct Pandas operations on the provided data.\nDefining Cell Logic: I have defined the Python code for the first Jupyter Notebook cell, focusing on data loading and mean expression calculations. The code now efficiently excludes the 'sample' column during the mean calculation, using `df.drop(columns=['sample'])`. I am preparing the script, now for the second cell, with a filter for means greater than 50.\nConstructing the Third Cell: I am now implementing the code for the third Jupyter Notebook cell, which is nearly complete. I've focused on generating a report of significant genes from the filtered data. The cell will create a Pandas DataFrame for the report and save the results as a CSV file to the location `/home/user/significant_genes.csv`. I'm making sure to exclude the index during the CSV output for a clean, report-ready file. I am preparing the assembled JSON string for the complete notebook.\nFinalizing the Filtering: I have completed the core filtering logic for the Jupyter Notebook. I've focused on precisely filtering the gene data. I have added code to create a DataFrame with the genes and their mean expressions and write the report to a CSV file. The file path is correctly set as '/home/user/significant_genes.csv'. I have ensured that the Pandas DataFrame is saved without the index. I'm now testing the notebook for functionality and ensuring correct output.\nValidating JSON Structure: I have validated the JSON structure for the Jupyter Notebook, ensuring all cells and metadata are correctly formatted. The code cells are now structured with the correct source code arrays. I'm focusing on the `source` array within each code cell, checking for proper string formatting and newlines within the Python code. I am confirming it is correctly formatted as a list of strings, with each string representing a line of code.\n\n```python\n\n```\nConfirming Final Cell Logic: I'm now focusing on finalizing cell structure within the JSON for the notebook. I've re-confirmed that I have exactly three cells, and that the cell definitions are correct. I'm verifying the Pandas DataFrame output for the report and I've ensured it uses the correct index and CSV file paths, and am happy with the output. I am preparing the script.",
