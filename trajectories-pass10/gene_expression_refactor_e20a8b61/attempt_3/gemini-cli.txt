I will create the Jupyter notebook that performs your gene expression analysis with the specified steps.

I have created the requested Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. It correctly maps your three requested steps to individual cells: loading and processing the raw CSV data (excluding the `sample` column), applying the greater-than-50 filter, and formatting/saving the final report with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns.
