I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` with the specified three cells. 

The notebook clearly imports `pandas`, processes the raw data to calculate the mean gene expression (ignoring the sample column), filters for genes strictly greater than 50, and creates the final cleaned dataset with the `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns.

The notebook is structurally sound and executing it will write the final output directly to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without an index, as requested.
