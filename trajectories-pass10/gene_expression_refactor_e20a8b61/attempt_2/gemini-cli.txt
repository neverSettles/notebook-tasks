I will first check the structure of the raw gene data file to ensure the data loading and calculations are set up correctly.
I will now test the python logic and generate the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`.
I will now generate the Jupyter Notebook (`/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`) mapping to your exact requested cells.
I have successfully created your Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`.

The notebook is cleanly structured into the requested exactly 3 cells:
*   **Cell 1** imports `pandas`, loads `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`, and calculates the gene expression means (excluding the 'sample' column).
*   **Cell 2** performs the filtering to keep only genes with a mean strictly greater than 50.
*   **Cell 3** formats the results into a new DataFrame with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and correctly saves it to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without an index.

I have also verified the pandas logic to ensure the notebook will execute from start to finish without errors.
