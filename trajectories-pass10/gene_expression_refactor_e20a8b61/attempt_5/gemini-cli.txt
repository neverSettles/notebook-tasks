I'll examine the raw data file first to confirm its structure before creating the Jupyter notebook.
I'll create the well-documented Jupyter notebook with your requested analysis steps.
I have created the requested Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. It's structured perfectly with clean markdown documentation and three distinct code cells that exactly fulfill your requirements:

1. **Cell 1:** Imports `pandas`, loads the CSV dataset, and calculates mean expression across all non-sample columns.
2. **Cell 2:** Filters those means so only genes strictly greater than 50 are kept.
3. **Cell 3:** Formats the final DataFrame to have only the `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and writes it to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the index. 

You can now open this `.ipynb` file in your preferred Jupyter environment and run it sequentially without errors.
