The notebook should read `/home/user/financial_news.csv`.\n\nHere is what the notebook needs to do:\n1. **Cell 1**: Import pandas and re. Define a custom stopword list: `['the', 'a', 'an', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'for', 'to', 'of', 'and', 'is', 'are']`.\n2. **Cell 2**: Load the data from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. **Cell 3**: Create a new column called `cleaned_headline`. To create this, process the `headline` column as follows:\n   - Convert all text to lowercase.\n   - Remove all punctuation (keep only lowercase letters `a-z`, digits `0-9`, and spaces).\n   - Split the text by spaces, and remove any words that exactly match the custom stopword list.\n   - Join the remaining words back together with a single space.\n4. **Cell 4**: Keep only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns. Save the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` (do not include the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook can be executed sequentially from start to finish without errors."

      "reasoning_content": "Defining the Objective: Okay, I'm defining the objective. The goal is to build a Jupyter notebook, `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`, focused on cleaning the financial news dataset `/home/user/financial_news.csv`. Initial steps involve defining the core notebook requirements.\nImplementing the Core Logic: I'm now implementing the core data cleaning logic within the notebook. I've defined the stopword list and am working on cells to load the data, clean the headlines using `pandas` and `re`, and then select and save the relevant columns. I will save this new, cleaned data to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv`. The notebook must execute without errors from beginning to end.\nRefining the Cleaning Process: I'm currently refining the cleaning process, focusing on cell implementation within the notebook. I've drafted cells to import `pandas` and `re`, establish the stopword list, load the CSV, and define a `clean_text` function. The function will now handle non-string inputs and convert text to lowercase before further processing. I'm aiming for robust handling of diverse data.\nFinalizing the Cleaning Function: I've just refined the text cleaning function within the notebook. It now effectively removes punctuation, retaining only alphanumeric characters and spaces. The function splits the text, filters out stopwords, and rejoins the remaining words. I've applied it to the 'headline' column. Now, I'm constructing cell 4, which selects the required columns and saves the cleaned data to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv`. The Jupyter Notebook's JSON structure is finalized.\nSaving the Results: I'm now completing the final notebook cell, focusing on saving the cleaned data. I'm selecting the 'date', 'cleaned_headline', and 'label' columns, storing them into `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` using `df.to_csv`. The Jupyter notebook's structure and execution flow are finalized. I'm verifying the notebook executes without errors and that `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` contains the expected clean data.\nConstructing the Notebook: I'm now focusing on formatting the Jupyter Notebook's JSON structure for file creation. I've implemented the `write_file` function to generate `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`. The notebook creation is now finalized based on the user's instructions.\nValidating the Logic: I'm now validating the logic of the `clean_text` function to ensure it addresses edge cases and meets user requirements, especially for column selection. I've re-examined the regex and confirmed it removes punctuation but keeps spaces, confirming the requirements for the headline column. I'm also ensuring the function handles non-string inputs gracefully. I'm focusing on the price column too, given this new column.\nRefining the Regex: I've confirmed the regex `re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9\\s]', '', text)` retains spaces as intended, ensuring the headline retains the original word separations. The text is now split into words and rejoined. I've built the Notebook JSON structure with import statements and data loading.\nValidating the output: I'm now validating the logic of my code, including the `clean_text` function to address edge cases. I've built the Notebook JSON structure with import statements and data loading to confirm it works. The regex is now confirmed and refined. I'm focusing on validating the final output.\n\nI have updated the regex.",
