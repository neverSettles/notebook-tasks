I will create the Jupyter notebook with the requested data cleaning steps and logic.

The Jupyter notebook has been successfully created at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`. It contains the 4 cells exactly as requested, ready to be executed sequentially to clean the `headline` column, filter out the stopwords, and save the resulting data to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv`.
