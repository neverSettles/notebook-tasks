I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been structured with the four cells exactly as you described:
1. Imports `pandas` and `re`, and defines the custom `stopwords` list.
2. Loads the `/home/user/financial_news.csv` file into a DataFrame.
3. Defines a text-cleaning function that converts the text to lowercase, removes all punctuation except lowercase letters and numbers, splits it, filters out the exact stopwords, and joins it back together. It then applies this logic to create the `cleaned_headline` column.
4. Filters the DataFrame to only include `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns, and saves the result to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without the index.

The cells are set up to run sequentially without errors.
