I will create the Jupyter notebook with the requested steps to clean the financial news data.

I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb` with the specified steps. It loads your financial news, cleans the headlines using regex and your custom stopword list, and exports the requested columns to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without the index. 

You can now open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially! Let me know if you need anything else.
