The notebook should read `/home/user/financial_news.csv`.\n\nHere is what the notebook needs to do:\n1. **Cell 1**: Import pandas and re. Define a custom stopword list: `['the', 'a', 'an', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'for', 'to', 'of', 'and', 'is', 'are']`.\n2. **Cell 2**: Load the data from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. **Cell 3**: Create a new column called `cleaned_headline`. To create this, process the `headline` column as follows:\n   - Convert all text to lowercase.\n   - Remove all punctuation (keep only lowercase letters `a-z`, digits `0-9`, and spaces).\n   - Split the text by spaces, and remove any words that exactly match the custom stopword list.\n   - Join the remaining words back together with a single space.\n4. **Cell 4**: Keep only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns. Save the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` (do not include the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook can be executed sequentially from start to finish without errors."

      "reasoning_content": "Defining the Notebook's Purpose: I'm starting with a clear goal: to build a Jupyter notebook that cleans financial news data. The notebook will read from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` and write the cleaned data to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv`. I'm focused on establishing the notebook's core functionality.\nDefining the Notebook Structure: I've moved on to solidify the structure, and have started mapping the notebook's JSON representation. I'm focusing on the `cells` array, defining their types, execution counts and content. I need to convert the defined requirements into valid JSON cells. I'm thinking of creating a function to automate some of this.\nConstructing the Notebook's Anatomy: I'm now diving into the specifics of cell creation within the JSON structure. I'm focusing on key elements within each cell such as metadata, outputs, and source code for the notebook, and I am structuring the notebook with nbformat 4.5. I've drafted the Python code for three core cells. The first imports pandas and the regex library and defines stop words, the second reads the CSV, and the third defines and applies a cleaning function to a headline column.\nFinalizing the Data Output: I've just added the final code cell which will select the necessary columns and export the data to the correct CSV, writing the cleaned output to the desired location. I'm ensuring there are no indexes in the output and the format is clean. After that I have finished constructing the code. I am thinking I am now ready to test.\nRefining the Text Cleaning: I've been refining the text cleaning function. I am focusing on cleaning, tokenizing, and removing stop words from headlines using regular expressions and list comprehensions. I'm now testing the code. I'm aiming for a robust and efficient approach to prepare the data.\nImplementing the Cleaning Function: I'm now zeroing in on the text cleaning function within Cell 3. I've written the Python code, ensuring it converts text to lowercase, removes punctuation, tokenizes the text, and removes stopwords. I'm using regular expressions and a list comprehension for a clear and efficient implementation within the pandas dataframe. The code is ready for testing.\nConfirming Notebook Construction: I'm now generating the final notebook file. I've validated the notebook's JSON structure. I'm calling the `write_file` tool to create the `clean_analysis.ipynb` file in the desired directory. I have also verified that all necessary backslashes have been escaped, so there are no syntax errors within the JSON. The notebook structure is now complete.",
