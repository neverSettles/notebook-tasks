I am writing the Jupyter Notebook with the specified data processing steps to `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`.
I have created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb` according to your requirements. 

It contains 4 cells mapped exactly to your instructions:
1. Imports `pandas` and `re`, and defines the `custom_stopwords` list.
2. Loads the `/home/user/financial_news.csv` data into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Defines a cleaning function to lower case the text, strip punctuation, drop exactly matched custom stopwords, and applies it to create the `cleaned_headline` column.
4. Selects only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns, and saves the dataframe without the index to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv`.
