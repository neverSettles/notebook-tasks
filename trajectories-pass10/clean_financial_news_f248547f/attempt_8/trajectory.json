The notebook should read `/home/user/financial_news.csv`.\n\nHere is what the notebook needs to do:\n1. **Cell 1**: Import pandas and re. Define a custom stopword list: `['the', 'a', 'an', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'for', 'to', 'of', 'and', 'is', 'are']`.\n2. **Cell 2**: Load the data from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. **Cell 3**: Create a new column called `cleaned_headline`. To create this, process the `headline` column as follows:\n   - Convert all text to lowercase.\n   - Remove all punctuation (keep only lowercase letters `a-z`, digits `0-9`, and spaces).\n   - Split the text by spaces, and remove any words that exactly match the custom stopword list.\n   - Join the remaining words back together with a single space.\n4. **Cell 4**: Keep only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns. Save the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` (do not include the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook can be executed sequentially from start to finish without errors."

      "reasoning_content": "Defining the Objective: I've clarified the primary objective: creating a Jupyter notebook to clean and process a financial news dataset. The required inputs are the unclean CSV file and the desired outputs are the notebook itself, plus the cleaned CSV file. The user has also provided the target file names and locations, which are to be used for the notebook's inputs and outputs.\nOutlining the Structure: I'm now outlining the structure of the Jupyter Notebook. I've broken it down into four key cells. Cell one focuses on imports and stopword definition. Cell two loads the CSV. Cell three cleans the headlines, and the final cell selects and saves the desired columns. I've also decided to use `write_file` to write the `.ipynb` file.\nConstructing the JSON Structure: I'm now deep in the JSON construction phase. I've successfully outlined the desired JSON structure for the Jupyter Notebook, complete with metadata and the list of cells. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy in the cell definitions, specifically for code import and stopword definition. I'm constructing a code cell for dataframe loading and cleaning headlines, aiming to represent the data wrangling in JSON correctly.\nFinalizing the Code Cells: I've finalized the code for the crucial headline cleaning process within the notebook's JSON structure. It now implements text lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and subsequent joining. This cell creates a new 'cleaned_headline' column in the DataFrame. Additionally, I've constructed the final code cell, responsible for selecting only the date, cleaned_headline, and price columns, before saving this cleaned data as a CSV file to the location specified.\nVerifying the Implementation: I'm now carefully verifying the headline-cleaning function, ensuring it correctly lowercases, removes punctuation, filters stopwords, and joins the remaining words. I've also checked the dataframe operations. Additionally, I'm taking a close look at JSON payload generation, double-checking for any errors, especially related to quote and newline escaping, before writing the `.ipynb` file. The final file should reside at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`.\nRefining the Notebook: I'm now integrating the final code snippets into the Jupyter Notebook's JSON structure, completing the notebook's code. This involves inserting the headline cleaning function and the final dataframe selection and CSV saving. With this, the notebook's construction in JSON is complete, and it is ready for deployment.",
