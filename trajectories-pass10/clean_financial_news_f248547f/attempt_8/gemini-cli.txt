I will create the Jupyter Notebook file with the requested data cleaning operations encoded into its cells.

The Jupyter Notebook has been successfully created at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`. It contains the 4 cells exactly as specified:

1. Imports `pandas`, `re`, and defines the custom `stopwords` list.
2. Loads `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a DataFrame.
3. Defines a text-cleaning function that lowercases, removes punctuation (keeping `a-z`, `0-9`, and spaces), strips stop words, and applies it to create the `cleaned_headline` column.
4. Filters the DataFrame to only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns, and exports it to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without an index. 

You can now open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially!
