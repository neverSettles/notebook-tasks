I will create the Jupyter notebook `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb` with the specified cells to clean the financial news data.

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb` with all the required steps. 

It is structured in exactly 4 cells:
1. Imports `pandas` and `re`, and defines the custom `stopwords` list.
2. Loads the `/home/user/financial_news.csv` dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Defines a `clean_text` function to process the headlines (lowercasing, punctuation removal via Regex, splitting, stopword filtering, and re-joining) and applies it to create the new `cleaned_headline` column.
4. Filters the DataFrame to keep only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns, and saves the result (without the index) to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv`. 

The notebook can now be executed sequentially from start to finish. Let me know if you need any adjustments or further assistance.
