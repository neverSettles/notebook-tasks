It works, but I need to present this to stakeholders. \n\nPlease convert this script into a well-structured Jupyter Notebook named `/home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`. \n\nHere is what you need to do:\n1. Read the provided `messy_ab_test.py` and `campaign_data.csv` in `/home/user/`.\n2. Create a new notebook `/home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`.\n3. Break the script down into logical, sequential cells:\n   - Cell 1: Import libraries\n   - Cell 2: Data Loading (load `campaign_data.csv`)\n   - Cell 3: Data Preprocessing & Summary (calculate conversion rates for each group)\n   - Cell 4: Statistical Testing (perform the chi-square test)\n   - Cell 5: Visualization (bar chart of conversion rates)\n   - Cell 6: Export Results\n4. Add descriptive Markdown cells *before* each code cell explaining what the next block of code does (e.g., \"## 1. Import Libraries\", \"## 2. Data Loading\").\n5. The notebook must produce the following outputs when executed:\n   - Save a bar chart of the conversion rates as `/home/user/conversion_plot.png`.\n   - Save the grouped summary data (Group, Total Visitors, Converted, Conversion Rate) as `/home/user/summary_stats.csv`.\n   \nMake sure the notebook runs perfectly from start to finish using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`."

Import Libraries*\n   - *2. Data Loading*\n   - *3. Data Preprocessing & Summary*\n   - *4. Statistical Testing*\n   - *5. Visualization*\n   - *6. Export Results*\n4. **Reliable Output Generation**: The analytical code calculates test conversions, uses a chi-square test for significance, generates a highly styled bar chart exported as `/home/user/conversion_plot.png`, and outputs the grouped data precisely formatted (Group, Total Visitors, Converted, Conversion Rate) as `/home/user/summary_stats.csv`.\n5. **Validation**: I thoroughly verified the notebook by executing `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb` and confirmed that both the statistical CSV and the visualization image were generated successfully without any errors.\n\nThe notebook is now thoroughly tested, logically separated, and ready to be presented to your stakeholders!",
