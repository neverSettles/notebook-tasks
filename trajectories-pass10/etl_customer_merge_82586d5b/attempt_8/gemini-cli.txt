The Jupyter notebook for your ETL merge step has been successfully created and validated. 

Here is what was accomplished:
1. **Sample Data Created**: As the initial CRM and E-commerce CSV files were empty, I generated sample datasets reflecting your described conflict scenarios (e.g., overlapping updates, CRM-only records, E-commerce-only records).
2. **Notebook Implementation**: A new notebook was generated at `/home/user/etl_merge.ipynb` that contains:
   - **Data Loading**: Reads the `crm_data.csv` and `ecom_data.csv` files and casts the timestamps correctly.
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Executes an outer merge. `email` and `phone` data defaults to the system with the strictly greater timestamp or falls back to CRM in the event of equal timestamps.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Correctly carries over `total_spent` from E-commerce (filled with `0.0` for CRM-only records) and `name` from CRM (filled with `Unknown` for E-commerce-only records). Overlapping and timestamp columns are safely dropped from the final output.
3. **Assertions Added**: Validates your requirements exactly (checking for exactly 5 rows, ensuring customer 3 uses `bob_new@ecom.com` due to timestamp recency, and confirming customer 4 has a `total_spent` of 0.0). 
4. **Validation Test**: I executed the notebook headlessly with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` and confirmed that it runs from top to bottom without any errors. The successfully merged data is saved at `/home/user/merged_customers.csv`.
