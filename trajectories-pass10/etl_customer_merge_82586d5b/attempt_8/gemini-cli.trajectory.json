Because customers update their info in both places, we have data conflicts that need to be resolved based on which record was updated most recently.\n\nCreate a notebook at `/home/user/etl_merge.ipynb` that does the following:\n\n1. **Load Data**: \n   - Load `/home/user/crm_data.csv` and `/home/user/ecom_data.csv`. \n\n2. **Merge & Resolve Conflicts**:\n   - Perform an outer join on the `customer_id` column.\n   - Both datasets have `email` and `phone` columns. \n   - Both datasets have a timestamp column: `crm_last_updated` and `ecom_last_updated`.\n   - For `email` and `phone`, resolve conflicts by selecting the value from the system with the most recent timestamp (`crm_last_updated` vs `ecom_last_updated`). If a record only exists in one system, use that system's values.\n   - If timestamps are exactly equal, prefer the CRM data.\n   - Keep the `total_spent` column from the e-commerce data (fill missing with 0.0).\n   - Keep the `name` column from the CRM data (fill missing with \"Unknown\").\n   - Drop the old overlapping columns and the timestamp columns. The final columns should be exactly: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `total_spent`.\n\n3. **Validation Cells**:\n   - Add a cell at the end of the notebook with `assert` statements to validate the exact output. \n   - Assert that the final DataFrame has exactly 5 rows.\n   - Assert that `customer_id` 3 has the email `bob_new@ecom.com` (because ecom was updated more recently).\n   - Assert that `customer_id` 4 has `total_spent` equal to 0.0 (since it only exists in CRM).\n\n4. **Save Output**:\n   - Save the cleaned, merged dataframe to `/home/user/merged_customers.csv` (without the index).\n\nYour notebook must run from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_merge.ipynb`."

Overlapping and timestamp columns are safely dropped from the final output.\n3. **Assertions Added**: Validates your requirements exactly (checking for exactly 5 rows, ensuring customer 3 uses `bob_new@ecom.com` due to timestamp recency, and confirming customer 4 has a `total_spent` of 0.0). \n4. **Validation Test**: I executed the notebook headlessly with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` and confirmed that it runs from top to bottom without any errors.
