          "text": "You need to build a data merging step for our ETL pipeline in a Jupyter notebook. We have customer records coming from two different systems: a CRM and an E-commerce platform. Because customers update their info in both places, we have data conflicts that need to be resolved based on which record was updated most recently.\n\nCreate a notebook at `/home/user/etl_merge.ipynb` that does the following:\n\n1. **Load Data**: \n   - Load `/home/user/crm_data.csv` and `/home/user/ecom_data.csv`. \n\n2. **Merge & Resolve Conflicts**:\n   - Perform an outer join on the `customer_id` column.\n   - Both datasets have `email` and `phone` columns. \n   - Both datasets have a timestamp column: `crm_last_updated` and `ecom_last_updated`.\n   - For `email` and `phone`, resolve conflicts by selecting the value from the system with the most recent timestamp (`crm_last_updated` vs `ecom_last_updated`). If a record only exists in one system, use that system's values.\n   - If timestamps are exactly equal, prefer the CRM data.\n   - Keep the `total_spent` column from the e-commerce data (fill missing with 0.0).\n   - Keep the `name` column from the CRM data (fill missing with \"Unknown\").\n   - Drop the old overlapping columns and the timestamp columns. The final columns should be exactly: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `total_spent`.\n\n3. **Validation Cells**:\n   - Add a cell at the end of the notebook with `assert` statements to validate the exact output. \n   - Assert that the final DataFrame has exactly 5 rows.\n   - Assert that `customer_id` 3 has the email `bob_new@ecom.com` (because ecom was updated more recently).\n   - Assert that `customer_id` 4 has `total_spent` equal to 0.0 (since it only exists in CRM).\n\n4. **Save Output**:\n   - Save the cleaned, merged dataframe to `/home/user/merged_customers.csv` (without the index).\n\nYour notebook must run from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_merge.ipynb`."

This ensures that if a record exists only in one system, that system automatically has the more recent timestamp.\n3. **Equivalence & Preference**: Evaluated timestamps directly using a strictly greater than condition (`ecom_last_updated > crm_last_updated`), properly deferring to CRM data in case of exact timestamp ties.\n4. **Column Cleanup**: Retained `total_spent` (with missing data filled as `0.0`) and `name` (with missing data filled as `\"Unknown\"`). The dataframe output was subset exactly to: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, and `total_spent`.\n5. **Validation and Output**: The notebook correctly asserts against the 5 rows requirement, the specific conditional values for Customer IDs 3 and 4, and safely exports the data to `/home/user/merged_customers.csv` without indexing.",
