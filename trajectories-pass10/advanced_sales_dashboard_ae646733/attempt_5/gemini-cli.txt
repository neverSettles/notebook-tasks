I will create a Python script that generates the requested Jupyter notebook to correctly format the notebook's JSON structure, and then I will execute it to verify it works.
I will execute the notebook creation script and run it through `jupyter nbconvert` to test and generate the outputs.
I will correct the formatting issues in the generation script and run it again.
I'll check the contents of the CSV files to see what data they hold before proceeding.
I will check the files' size to see if they are completely empty.
I will generate some dummy test data for the CSV files to rigorously test the notebook execution.
I will execute the script again now that the mock data has been created, to verify that the generated notebook performs all required calculations and aggregations correctly.
I will verify the format of the output files produced by the notebook to ensure they perfectly match your specifications.
I will clean up the notebook generation script to ensure the code is robust against edge cases, and finalize the `dashboard.ipynb` generation. After ensuring the notebook works flawlessly, I will revert the mock CSV files to their empty state to leave the workspace pristine.
