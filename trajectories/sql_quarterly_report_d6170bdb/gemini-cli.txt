I will now execute the Jupyter notebook to perform the data processing, generate the SQLite database, query the data, export the report, and create the revenue plot.
I'll fix the JSON formatting issue by using Python to construct and save the Jupyter notebook properly.
I'll execute the newly formatted Jupyter notebook to generate the report and plot.
I will now verify that the expected files (the database, the report CSV, and the plot image) were generated successfully.
I will update the Jupyter notebook file with the executed output directly and remove the intermediate `.nbconvert` file.
I will now verify the contents of the generated CSV report to ensure it meets your specific formatting requirements.
The Jupyter notebook has been created, executed, and all requested output files have been generated successfully. 

Here is a summary of what was accomplished:
1. **Notebook Created and Executed**: `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` was generated with all necessary logic and run successfully.
2. **Database Created**: `/home/user/sales.db` was created via `sqlite3` and populated with a `sales` table based on your `raw_sales.csv`.
3. **Report Exported**: `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` was generated from the SQL query results (`pandas.read_sql`) containing `region` and `total_revenue` columns, without an index, and sorted alphabetically by region.
4. **Plot Generated**: A bar chart visualizing total revenue by region was successfully saved to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.
