The notebook works and saves the data, but it is too slow because it fetches the 20 pages sequentially. Each request takes about 0.5 seconds, so the whole process takes over 10 seconds. \n\nYour task is to optimize the notebook to complete the data collection in under 3 seconds. You must use parallel execution (e.g., `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) to fetch the pages concurrently.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Modify `/home/user/fetch_data.ipynb`.\n2. Fetch all 20 pages (pages 1 to 20 inclusive) using the `get_expression_data(page)` function from the provided `mock_api` module.\n3. Combine all retrieved records into a single pandas DataFrame.\n4. Sort the DataFrame by the `gene_id` column in ascending order.\n5. Save the final DataFrame to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without the index.\n6. The entire execution of the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` must take less than 4 seconds.\n\nThe `mock_api.py` module and the slow `fetch_data.ipynb` are already in `/home/user`."

Used `executor.map()` to trigger parallel API calls via `mock_api.get_expression_data` for pages 1 to 20 simultaneously.\n3. Automatically combined the retrieved records into a unified pandas `DataFrame`, handling various potential data formats (like lists of records or DataFrames) seamlessly.\n4. Sorted the data primarily by the `gene_id` column in ascending order.\n5. Saved the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without preserving the index column. \n\nThe notebook has been fully tested using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/fetch_data.ipynb` and easily completes its operation within the 4-second required limit.",
