The Jupyter notebook has been created at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`. It contains the following steps:

1.  **Imports & Stopwords**: Imports `pandas` and `re`, and defines the custom stopword list.
2.  **Load Data**: Reads `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a DataFrame.
3.  **Clean Data**: Processes the `headline` column to create `cleaned_headline` by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and filtering out the specified stopwords.
4.  **Save Data**: Selects the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns and saves the result to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv`.
