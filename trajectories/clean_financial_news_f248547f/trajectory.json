The notebook should read `/home/user/financial_news.csv`.\n\nHere is what the notebook needs to do:\n1. **Cell 1**: Import pandas and re. Define a custom stopword list: `['the', 'a', 'an', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'for', 'to', 'of', 'and', 'is', 'are']`.\n2. **Cell 2**: Load the data from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. **Cell 3**: Create a new column called `cleaned_headline`. To create this, process the `headline` column as follows:\n   - Convert all text to lowercase.\n   - Remove all punctuation (keep only lowercase letters `a-z`, digits `0-9`, and spaces).\n   - Split the text by spaces, and remove any words that exactly match the custom stopword list.\n   - Join the remaining words back together with a single space.\n4. **Cell 4**: Keep only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns. Save the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` (do not include the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook can be executed sequentially from start to finish without errors."

      "message": "Defining the Project Scope: Okay, I'm starting by clarifying the objective: creating a Jupyter Notebook to transform the financial news data. The goal is a clean CSV output. I'm focusing on the input and desired outputs, ensuring I fully grasp the scope. I need to be precise on the paths of data, and what the \"cleaning\" entails.\nOutlining the Notebook Structure: I'm now detailing the notebook's architecture. I've broken it down into individual cells, defining the code each must contain. I'm focusing on the imports, data loading, and the crucial cleaning steps, including converting to lowercase, removing punctuation and stopwords, and finally, saving the tidy data. I'm taking care to ensure it runs without errors.\nConstructing the Core Notebook: I'm now implementing the core functionality within the Jupyter Notebook. Cell 2 loads the CSV data, while Cell 3 defines and applies the text cleaning function. I'm making certain the cleaning process handles non-string inputs and removes punctuation and stopwords effectively, converting everything to lowercase. Finally, Cell 4 selects the desired columns and saves the cleaned data to a new CSV. I've double checked the paths and the structure.\nRefining the Text Cleaning: I'm now implementing the text cleaning function within the notebook. I've added code to handle non-string inputs gracefully by returning an empty string. The cleaning process includes converting text to lowercase and removing punctuation, leaving only lowercase letters, numbers, and spaces. I'm importing pandas and the regex library, with a list of stopwords.\nFinalizing the Cleaning Function: I've refined the cleaning function. Now, I split the cleaned text by spaces, and I'm removing words matching the stopwords list. I'm carefully removing any words that exactly match the custom stopword list. Finally, I'm joining the remaining words back with a single space to construct the cleaned text. The function is applied to the headline column to produce 'cleaned_headline'. I'm also preparing the data to be written.\n\nI'm now selecting only the essential columns ('date', 'cleaned_headline', 'price') and saving the cleaned data into a new CSV file. The CSV includes a date, the cleaned headlines, and the relevant prices. The data is saving to the desired file path without the index column. The file is now outputting.\nGenerating the Notebook File: I'm now generating the Jupyter Notebook file itself using the refined cleaning function. The notebook, named `clean_analysis.ipynb`, is being created with the specified code. I am ensuring that the created file uses the user's specific text exactly, and I am finalizing the output. The file is being written, I have double checked the steps.\nCreating the JSON Structure: I'm now generating the Jupyter Notebook as a JSON structure to be written to the file. I'm focusing on ensuring the cell types are correct, the data is loaded, and the cleaning function is defined. The stopword list is now included, and the data is read in.\nRefining the Output: I'm now focusing on refining the output process within the JSON structure for the Jupyter Notebook. I've incorporated the cleaning process within the cell, using a list comprehension to filter out stopwords, and converting to a string to handle potential non-string inputs. I am now applying this function to the headline column to produce the 'cleaned_headline' column, selecting the desired columns, and saving the cleaned data into the output file.",
