I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that performs the required ETL steps. 

The notebook has been verified by running `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`, and it cleanly generates the `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` file without the pandas index. The output contains exactly the expected columns (`region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`) ranked descending using the `RANK()` window function.
