I will write the Jupyter notebook containing the analysis to `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`.
I will quickly verify the execution of the notebook.
I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`.

The notebook follows your exact specifications:
- **Cell 1**: Loads `pandas`, imports the dataset, and calculates the mean expression for all genes excluding the `sample` column.
- **Cell 2**: Filters out the genes to only retain those with a mean expression strictly greater than 50.
- **Cell 3**: Generates a DataFrame with the columns `Gene` and `Mean_Expression`, and exports it without the index to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv`.

The code has been verified and runs properly without errors.
