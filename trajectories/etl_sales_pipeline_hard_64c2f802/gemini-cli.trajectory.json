If an item has no valid expenses at all, fill with 0.\n   \n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - Calculate a new column `profit` = `revenue - expenses`.\n   - Map `store_id` to `region_name` using the JSON data. For any `store_id` not found in the JSON, set `region_name` to `\"Unknown\"`.\n   - Filter the dataset to **exclude** any transactions where `profit < 0` (keep only zero or positive profit rows).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - Save the fully cleaned, merged, and filtered dataset to `/home/user/clean_data.csv` (do not include the pandas index).\n   - Create an Excel file `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx` containing two sheets:\n     - Sheet 1 named `\"Region_Profit\"`: Total profit per region, sorted by total profit in descending order. Columns must be `region_name`, `total_profit`.\n     - Sheet 2 named `\"Top_Items\"`: For each region, find the top 2 `item_code`s by total profit. Sort by `region_name` alphabetically, then by profit descending. Columns must be `region_name`, `item_code`, `item_profit`.\n\nThe notebook must be fully executable from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs."
