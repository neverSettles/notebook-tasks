I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook that meets all your requirements.

The notebook `/home/user/etl_merge.ipynb` has been fully implemented to:
1. **Load the Data**: It reads from `/home/user/crm_data.csv` and `/home/user/ecom_data.csv`.
2. **Merge & Resolve Conflicts**: It merges the data using an outer join on `customer_id`. It dynamically resolves conflicts for `email` and `phone` by using the data with the more recent timestamp (or falling back to CRM on equal timestamps), handles missing fields correctly, and keeps only the requested final columns. 
3. **Save**: It correctly saves the clean dataset without an index to `/home/user/merged_customers.csv`.
4. **Validation**: The final cell contains all of the requested assertions which validate the number of rows, the specific update for customer 3's email, and the 0.0 value for customer 4's total spent.

I also verified that the notebook executes seamlessly from top to bottom using the provided `jupyter nbconvert` command.
