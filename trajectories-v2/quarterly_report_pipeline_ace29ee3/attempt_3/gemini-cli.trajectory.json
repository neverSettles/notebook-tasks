          "text": "You are a Business Analyst creating a cron-ready Jupyter notebook to automate a quarterly performance report.\n\nYour task is to create a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` that processes customer feedback and merges it with sales data. Since this notebook will run automatically, it must include robust text cleaning and explicit validation steps.\n\nThe notebook must perform the following steps in order:\n\n1. **Load Data**: \n   - Load `/home/user/raw_feedback.csv` (columns: `id`, `date`, `feedback`, `agent_id`).\n   - Load `/home/user/sales.json` (a list of dictionaries containing `agent_id` and `revenue`).\n\n2. **Text Cleaning**:\n   Process the `feedback` column to handle several edge cases:\n   - **HTML Tags**: Remove all HTML tags, including nested tags (e.g., `<div><p>text</p></div>` should become `text`). Ensure content between tags is preserved, except for `<script>` tags where you should remove the tags but you can leave the content. (Just standard regex or BeautifulSoup tag removal is fine).\n   - **HTML Entities**: Decode HTML entities (e.g., `&amp;` becomes `&`, `&lt;` becomes `<`).\n   - **Unicode Normalization**: Normalize all unicode characters to NFKC form.\n   - **PII Redaction**: \n     - Replace all email addresses with the exact string `[EMAIL]`.\n     - Replace all phone numbers matching the format `XXX-XXX-XXXX` with the exact string `[PHONE]`.\n   - **Whitespace**: Strip leading/trailing whitespace and replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space.\n\n3. **Data Merging**:\n   - Merge the cleaned feedback dataframe with the sales dataframe on `agent_id` (inner join).\n\n4. **Validation (Crucial for automation)**:\n   Add a cell at the end of the notebook containing `assert` statements to validate the pipeline:\n   - Assert that no HTML tags remain in the `feedback` column (using a regex like `<[^>]+>`).\n   - Assert that no emails remain in the `feedback` column.\n   - Assert that no phone numbers of the format `XXX-XXX-XXXX` remain in the `feedback` column.\n   - Assert that the final dataframe has exactly 5 rows.\n\n5. **Export**:\n   - Save the final merged dataframe to `/home/user/final_report.csv` without the index.\n\nRequirements:\n- Only use standard data science libraries (pandas, numpy, re, html, unicodedata).\n- The notebook must be executable from start to finish via `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` without raising any assertion errors.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Cleaning examples:**\n- Input: `<p>Great service by agent!</p> Contact me at john@email.com.`\n- After HTML stripping: `Great service by agent! Contact me at john@email.com.`\n- After email redaction: `Great service by agent! Contact me at [EMAIL].`\n- After whitespace trim: `Great service by agent! Contact me at [EMAIL].`\n"

Do NOT use `&` to background commands. Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

All data cleaning, merging, and validation steps are integrated and working perfectly without raising any assertions.\n\nHere is a summary of the implemented pipeline in `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`:\n1. **Load Data**: Uses Pandas to read both `raw_feedback.csv` and `sales.json`.\n2. **Text Cleaning**: A structured cleaner function handles edge cases precisely:\n   - Removes HTML tags (including nested) using standard regex `<[^>]+>`, which correctly leaves content from tags intact.\n   - Decodes HTML entities using the `html` library.\n   - Normalizes unicode sequences using `unicodedata.normalize` (NFKC).\n   - Redacts PII using custom regex patterns for both emails and standard phone number formats.\n   - Normalizes all whitespaces with `.strip()` and consecutive whitespace replacement.\n3. **Data Merging**: Merges both dataframes effectively with an inner join on `agent_id`.\n4. **Validation**: Employs robust assertions matching your requested logic to guarantee data hygiene before exporting (0 HTML tags, 0 emails, 0 phones, exactly 5 rows).\n5. **Export**: Automatically saves the sanitized outcome without an index to `/home/user/final_report.csv`.\n\nThe notebook ran completely via `jupyter nbconvert`, and the final cleaned dataset has successfully been generated at `/home/user/final_report.csv`.",
