Since this notebook will run automatically, it must include robust text cleaning and explicit validation steps.\n\nThe notebook must perform the following steps in order:\n\n1. **Load Data**: \n   - Load `/home/user/raw_feedback.csv` (columns: `id`, `date`, `feedback`, `agent_id`).\n   - Load `/home/user/sales.json` (a list of dictionaries containing `agent_id` and `revenue`).\n\n2. **Text Cleaning**:\n   Process the `feedback` column to handle several edge cases:\n   - **HTML Tags**: Remove all HTML tags, including nested tags (e.g., `<div><p>text</p></div>` should become `text`). Ensure content between tags is preserved, except for `<script>` tags where you should remove the tags but you can leave the content. (Just standard regex or BeautifulSoup tag removal is fine).\n   - **HTML Entities**: Decode HTML entities (e.g., `&amp;` becomes `&`, `&lt;` becomes `<`).\n   - **Unicode Normalization**: Normalize all unicode characters to NFKC form.\n   - **PII Redaction**: \n     - Replace all email addresses with the exact string `[EMAIL]`.\n     - Replace all phone numbers matching the format `XXX-XXX-XXXX` with the exact string `[PHONE]`.\n   - **Whitespace**: Strip leading/trailing whitespace and replace multiple consecutive spaces with a single space.\n\n3. **Data Merging**:\n   - Merge the cleaned feedback dataframe with the sales dataframe on `agent_id` (inner join).\n\n4. **Validation (Crucial for automation)**:\n   Add a cell at the end of the notebook containing `assert` statements to validate the pipeline:\n   - Assert that no HTML tags remain in the `feedback` column (using a regex like `<[^>]+>`).\n   - Assert that no emails remain in the `feedback` column.\n   - Assert that no phone numbers of the format `XXX-XXX-XXXX` remain in the `feedback` column.\n   - Assert that the final dataframe has exactly 5 rows.\n\n5. **Export**:\n   - Save the final merged dataframe to `/home/user/final_report.csv` without the index.\n\nRequirements:\n- Only use standard data science libraries (pandas, numpy, re, html, unicodedata).\n- The notebook must be executable from start to finish via `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` without raising any assertion errors.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Cleaning examples:**\n- Input: `<p>Great service by agent!</p> Contact me at john@email.com.`\n- After HTML stripping: `Great service by agent! Contact me at john@email.com.`\n- After email redaction: `Great service by agent! Contact me at [EMAIL].`\n- After whitespace trim: `Great service by agent! Contact me at [EMAIL].`\n"
