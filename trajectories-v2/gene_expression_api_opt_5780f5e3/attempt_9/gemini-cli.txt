I will read the current notebook and the mock API to understand the existing code.
I will also check the `mock_api.py` to see the returned data structure.
I will modify the notebook to use a thread pool executor, enabling it to fetch all 20 pages concurrently.
I will now execute the notebook to ensure it generates the required data under 4 seconds.
I'll check the generated notebook or the output CSV to confirm it was successful and contains 200 rows with the correct columns.
I will check the execution time from the notebook output.
I will do a final check on the CSV file to ensure it's correctly sorted and contains the proper number of rows.
I have updated the `fetch_data.ipynb` notebook to use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, which fetches all 20 pages concurrently.

The modified notebook fulfills all requirements:
1. Fetches pages 1 to 20 simultaneously.
2. Combines them into a single pandas DataFrame.
3. Sorts the DataFrame by `gene_id` in ascending order.
4. Outputs columns strictly as `gene_id`, `expression_level`, `sample_id`.
5. Saves to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without the index.
6. Execution time is significantly reduced to roughly 0.5 seconds (well under the 3-4 second limit).

I also executed the notebook using the provided command to ensure the CSV and outputs are correctly generated.
