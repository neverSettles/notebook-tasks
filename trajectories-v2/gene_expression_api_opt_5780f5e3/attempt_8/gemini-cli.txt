I have optimized the `/home/user/fetch_data.ipynb` notebook to use `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel data fetching. This change successfully reduced the data extraction time from over 10 seconds to approximately 0.51 seconds. 

The notebook has been modified, and after executing it with the `jupyter nbconvert` command, the `/home/user/expression_data.csv` file was generated correctly. It includes all 200 rows, sorted by `gene_id` in ascending order, with the specified columns (`gene_id`, `expression_level`, `sample_id`), and without the index.
