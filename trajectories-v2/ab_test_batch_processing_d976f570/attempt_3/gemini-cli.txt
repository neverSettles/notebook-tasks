I will create the Jupyter notebook with the required batch processing, statistical tests, validation logic, and execution steps.

I will now execute the Jupyter notebook to generate the output files and validate the data processing using `jupyter nbconvert`.

I will check the formatting of the notebook file I just created, as the JSON parsing failed.

I will recreate the notebook file using a Python script to ensure the JSON formatting is perfect, avoiding any parsing issues with string escaping.

I will now execute the corrected notebook to ensure the results are generated and validated correctly.

I will verify that the expected JSON summary file has been created correctly by printing its contents.

The Jupyter notebook has been created, formatted correctly, and successfully executed to generate the requested analysis.

The notebook processes all CSVs matching `/home/user/data/campaign_day_*.csv`, gracefully handling corrupted files, aggregates the necessary data, performs the chi-square analysis, and successfully outputs the aggregated summary at `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`. The validation assertions pass cleanly. 

You can find your summary JSON output natively at the path you specified, containing the required metrics: `impressions`, `conversions`, `conversion_rate` for each group, processed/failed file counts, and the statistical tests (`chi_square_statistic` and `p_value`).
