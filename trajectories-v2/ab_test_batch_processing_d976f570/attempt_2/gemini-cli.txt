I have created the Jupyter notebook with robust data processing, error handling, aggregation, validation, and statistical significance testing. I also executed it to generate the JSON report.

The notebook `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` successfully loops through the CSV logs, safely catching corrupted files like `campaign_day_3.csv`, and writes the final structure out to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`. The output correctly captures the conversion rate and the results of the chi-square test of independence.
