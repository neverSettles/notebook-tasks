I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter notebook to standardize your messy inventory data according to your specifications. 

The notebook (`/home/user/standardize_data.ipynb`) was generated with the necessary pandas logic and then executed as requested using `jupyter nbconvert`.

Here is a summary of the operations performed by the notebook:
1. **Column Standardization**: Cleaned whitespace, converted to lowercase, and replaced spaces with underscores.
2. **`product_price` Cleaning**: Removed the `$` symbol, safely coerced strings like 'N/A' and 'Unknown' into missing values (`NaN`), and cast the column to a float type.
3. **`date_added` Standardization**: Parsed mixed date formats into `datetime` objects safely, and formatted them into `'YYYY-MM-DD'` strings, ensuring unparseable strings were converted to missing values (`NaN`).
4. **`item_id` typing**: Ensured the identifier values were cast into a standard `integer` type.

The run outputted the expected files:
- **Cleaned Data File:** `/home/user/clean_inventory.csv`
- **Schema Report:** `/home/user/schema_report.json`
