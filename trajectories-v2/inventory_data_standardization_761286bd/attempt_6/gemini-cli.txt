I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter notebook to clean and standardize your inventory data.

Here's a summary of what was accomplished according to your requirements:
1. **Notebook Creation**: The Jupyter notebook was created at `/home/user/standardize_data.ipynb` using `pandas` for all the data manipulation.
2. **Column Standardization**: Cleaned up the headers by stripping whitespace, converting to lowercase, and replacing spaces with underscores (`item_id`, `product_name`, `product_price`, `date_added`).
3. **Price Cleaning**: Removed the `$` symbol, replaced missing placeholder values (`N/A` and `Unknown`) with `NaN`, and converted the `product_price` column to a `float64` type.
4. **Date Parsing**: Parsed the mixed date formats in `date_added` using `format="mixed"` and coerced errors to `NaT`. Then, the valid dates were formatted out as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, ensuring missing/unparseable dates resulted in missing values.
5. **Item ID Formatting**: Coerced `item_id` to strictly be an `int64` integer type.
6. **Execution & Generation**: The notebook was executed headless using `jupyter nbconvert`, successfully saving the cleaned, index-free data to `/home/user/clean_inventory.csv` and generating the target JSON dictionary at `/home/user/schema_report.json`.
