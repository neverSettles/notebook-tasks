          "text": "I need you to build a Jupyter notebook that acts as an ETL pipeline to transform some messy sales data. \nPlease create a notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.\n\nThe raw data is located at `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`. It contains daily sales in a wide format with dates as columns.\n\nThe notebook should have distinct cells for each step of the pipeline and output specific checkpoint files so we can audit the transformations.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Load the raw data from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\n2. **Step 1 (Melt)**: Reshape the data from wide to long format. The identifier variables should be `Store_ID` and `Region`. The variable column should be named `Date` and the value column should be named `Sales`. Fill any missing `Sales` values with 0. Save this intermediate dataframe to `/home/user/checkpoint_1_long.csv` (without the index).\n3. **Step 2 (Clean & Aggregate)**: Convert the `Date` column to datetime. Extract the year-month string (format: 'YYYY-MM') into a new column called `Month`. Then, aggregate the total sales by `Store_ID` and `Month`. Save this aggregated dataframe to `/home/user/checkpoint_2_agg.csv` (without the index). The columns should be exactly `Store_ID`, `Month`, and `Total_Sales`.\n4. **Step 3 (Pivot)**: Pivot the aggregated data back into a clean wide format for a final report. The index should be `Store_ID`, the columns should be the unique `Month` values, and the values should be the `Total_Sales`. Save this final dataframe to `/home/user/final_report.csv` (keeping the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook runs perfectly from start to finish with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Expected Data Shapes:**\n- `checkpoint_1_long.csv`: Should have 12 rows (3 stores x 4 date columns melted) with columns `Store_ID`, `Region`, `Month`, `Sales`. Melt ALL date columns (2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-02-01, 2023-02-02) into a `Month` column.\n- `checkpoint_2_agg.csv`: Should have 6 rows (3 stores x 2 months) after aggregating sales by Store_ID, Region, and month (extract YYYY-MM from the date).\n- `final_report.csv`: Should have 3 rows (one per store) in wide format with months as columns.\n"

Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n         ==========================\n         \n         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\n         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\n         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\n         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n         \n         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\n         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\n         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\n         software.\n         \n         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\n         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\n         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\n         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\n         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\n         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\n         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n         \n         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\n         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\n         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\n         the various releases.\n         \n             Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                             from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n         \n         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n             is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n         \n         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\n         direction to make these releases possible.\n         \n         \n         B.
