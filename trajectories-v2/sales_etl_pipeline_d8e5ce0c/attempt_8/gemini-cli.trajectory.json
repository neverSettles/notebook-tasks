          "text": "I need you to build a Jupyter notebook that acts as an ETL pipeline to transform some messy sales data. \nPlease create a notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.\n\nThe raw data is located at `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`. It contains daily sales in a wide format with dates as columns.\n\nThe notebook should have distinct cells for each step of the pipeline and output specific checkpoint files so we can audit the transformations.\n\nHere are the requirements:\n1. Load the raw data from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\n2. **Step 1 (Melt)**: Reshape the data from wide to long format. The identifier variables should be `Store_ID` and `Region`. The variable column should be named `Date` and the value column should be named `Sales`. Fill any missing `Sales` values with 0. Save this intermediate dataframe to `/home/user/checkpoint_1_long.csv` (without the index).\n3. **Step 2 (Clean & Aggregate)**: Convert the `Date` column to datetime. Extract the year-month string (format: 'YYYY-MM') into a new column called `Month`. Then, aggregate the total sales by `Store_ID` and `Month`. Save this aggregated dataframe to `/home/user/checkpoint_2_agg.csv` (without the index). The columns should be exactly `Store_ID`, `Month`, and `Total_Sales`.\n4. **Step 3 (Pivot)**: Pivot the aggregated data back into a clean wide format for a final report. The index should be `Store_ID`, the columns should be the unique `Month` values, and the values should be the `Total_Sales`. Save this final dataframe to `/home/user/final_report.csv` (keeping the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook runs perfectly from start to finish with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Expected Data Shapes:**\n- `checkpoint_1_long.csv`: Should have 12 rows (3 stores x 4 date columns melted) with columns `Store_ID`, `Region`, `Month`, `Sales`. Melt ALL date columns (2023-01-01, 2023-01-02, 2023-02-01, 2023-02-02) into a `Month` column.\n- `checkpoint_2_agg.csv`: Should have 6 rows (3 stores x 2 months) after aggregating sales by Store_ID, Region, and month (extract YYYY-MM from the date).\n- `final_report.csv`: Should have 3 rows (one per store) in wide format with months as columns.\n"
