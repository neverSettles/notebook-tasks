I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter notebook to perform the required ETL pipeline on your sales data.

The notebook `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` was generated with the following steps:
1. **Step 1 (Melt):** Loaded `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`, melted the data into a long format with columns `Store_ID`, `Region`, `Date`, and `Sales`, filled missing sales values with 0, and saved the result to `/home/user/checkpoint_1_long.csv`.
2. **Step 2 (Clean & Aggregate):** Converted the `Date` column to a datetime object, extracted the year and month into a new `Month` column, aggregated the total sales by `Store_ID` and `Month`, and saved the resulting dataframe to `/home/user/checkpoint_2_agg.csv`.
3. **Step 3 (Pivot):** Pivoted the aggregated data back into a wide format, setting the `Store_ID` as the index and `Month` as the columns, and saved the final report to `/home/user/final_report.csv`.

I then executed the notebook to ensure all the output CSV files were properly generated according to the requirements. You can verify the expected structures in the respective checkpoint files.
