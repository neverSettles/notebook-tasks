          "text": "You need to build a data merging step for our ETL pipeline in a Jupyter notebook. We have customer records coming from two different systems: a CRM and an E-commerce platform. Because customers update their info in both places, we have data conflicts that need to be resolved based on which record was updated most recently.\n\nCreate a notebook at `/home/user/etl_merge.ipynb` that does the following:\n\n1. **Load Data**: \n   - Load `/home/user/crm_data.csv` and `/home/user/ecom_data.csv`. \n\n2. **Merge & Resolve Conflicts**:\n   - Perform an outer join on the `customer_id` column.\n   - Both datasets have `email` and `phone` columns. \n   - Both datasets have a timestamp column: `crm_last_updated` and `ecom_last_updated`.\n   - For `email` and `phone`, resolve conflicts by selecting the value from the system with the most recent timestamp (`crm_last_updated` vs `ecom_last_updated`). If a record only exists in one system, use that system's values.\n   - If timestamps are exactly equal, prefer the CRM data.\n   - Keep the `total_spent` column from the e-commerce data (fill missing with 0.0).\n   - Keep the `name` column from the CRM data (fill missing with \"Unknown\").\n   - Drop the old overlapping columns and the timestamp columns. The final columns should be exactly: `customer_id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `total_spent`.\n\n3. **Validation Cells**:\n   - Add a cell at the end of the notebook with `assert` statements to validate the exact output. \n   - Assert that the final DataFrame has exactly 5 rows.\n   - Assert that `customer_id` 3 has the email `bob_new@ecom.com` (because ecom was updated more recently).\n   - Assert that `customer_id` 4 has `total_spent` equal to 0.0 (since it only exists in CRM).\n\n4. **Save Output**:\n   - Save the cleaned, merged dataframe to `/home/user/merged_customers.csv` (without the index).\n\nYour notebook must run from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_merge.ipynb`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_merge.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Merge Rules:**\n- When merging, the CRM data takes priority for `name` and `email` fields. The e-commerce data takes priority for `phone` (since CRM phone may be outdated).\n- The `last_purchase_date` comes from e-commerce data only.\n- Preserve the exact phone format from the e-commerce data (e.g., if ecom has `555-1234`, use that exact format).\n"

Validation assertions were included for `customer_id` 3's email and `customer_id` 4's total spent. The exact final columns `[customer_id, name, email, phone, total_spent]` were selected, dropping all intermediate overlapping fields.\n5. **Execution**: I've executed the notebook using the exact command requested. The ETL pipeline ran perfectly from top to bottom, passing all assertions, and safely saved the results without an index to `/home/user/merged_customers.csv`.",
