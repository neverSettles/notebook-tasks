I'll start by reading the prototype Python script to understand its current logic and data generation process. Then, I'll convert it into the requested Jupyter Notebook format.
I will now write the required Jupyter Notebook structure to the specified file and then execute it using `nbconvert` as requested.
I will execute the Jupyter Notebook to generate the summary output CSV and ensure all assertions pass.
I will run a python script to correctly generate the Jupyter Notebook as a valid JSON file and then execute it again.
I will verify that the execution successfully created the final output file as expected.
I have successfully converted your prototype script into the requested Jupyter Notebook and executed it to ensure it functions perfectly. 

Here is a summary of the completed steps:
1. **Created Notebook**: Formatted the `production_sales_analysis.ipynb` into a structured Jupyter format.
2. **Added Markdown Context**: Included the `# Sales Analysis Production` title along with descriptions prior to the data generation and validation segments.
3. **Structured Code Execution**: Separated the code into distinct logical cells—imports & data generation, core computation, data integrity assertions, and CSV exporting.
4. **Included Validation Checks**: Integrated assertions to guarantee exactly 100 rows, a non-negative minimum `discounted_price`, and consistency between the total sum of the raw data and the summarized groups.
5. **Preserved Logic**: Maintained the original deterministic data generation including `np.random.seed(42)`.
6. **Executed File**: Successfully executed the notebook head-to-tail which populated the `/home/user/final_sales_summary.csv` output file exactly as the original prototype did.
