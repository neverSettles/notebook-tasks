I need you to create a clean, well-documented Jupyter notebook that performs the analysis steps clearly.\n\nThere is a raw dataset located at `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`. \n\nPlease create a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` that does the following:\n\n**Cell 1: Data Loading & Calculation**\n- Import pandas.\n- Load `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`.\n- Calculate the mean expression for each gene (all columns except the `sample` column).\n\n**Cell 2: Filtering**\n- Filter the calculated means to keep ONLY the genes with a mean expression strictly greater than 50.\n\n**Cell 3: Report Generation**\n- Create a DataFrame from the filtered results with exactly two columns: `Gene` and `Mean_Expression`.\n- Save this DataFrame to a CSV file at `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the index (`index=False`).\n\nThe notebook must be executable from start to finish without errors.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Differential Expression Analysis:**\nAfter the basic restructuring:\n1. Calculate the log2 fold-change between the maximum and minimum expression values for each gene.\n2. Save the top 5 genes by absolute fold-change to `/home/user/top_genes.csv` with columns: `gene_id`, `fold_change`, `max_expression`, `min_expression`.\n3. Generate a bar chart of these top 5 genes and save to `/home/user/top_genes_plot.png`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"
