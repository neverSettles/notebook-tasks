We have a raw gene expression dataset in CSV format, but our pipelines require the data in JSON and Excel formats, and the dataset needs basic cleaning.\n\nWrite a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb` that performs the following steps in separate, well-documented cells:\n\n1. **Load Data**: Read the dataset from `/home/user/raw_genes.csv`.\n2. **Standardize Column Names**: Convert all column names to lowercase, replace spaces and hyphens with underscores. Specifically, the columns `Gene ID`, `Expression Level`, and `P-Value` should become `gene_id`, `expression_level`, and `p_value`.\n3. **Filter Data**: Remove any rows where `expression_level` is strictly less than 10.0.\n4. **Format Conversion & Export**: Save the cleaned and filtered DataFrame to two different formats:\n   - A JSON file at `/home/user/clean_genes.json` (use `orient='records'`).\n   - An Excel file at `/home/user/clean_genes.xlsx` (use `index=False`).\n\nMake sure the notebook runs without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb`.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Data Normalization and Summary:**\nAfter the format conversion:\n1. Normalize expression values per sample using min-max scaling (0-1 range per sample column).\n2. Save the normalized data to `/home/user/normalized_expression.csv`.\n3. Generate an executive summary JSON at `/home/user/expression_summary.json` with: `\"total_genes\"` (int), `\"total_samples\"` (int), `\"mean_expression\"` (float), `\"highly_expressed_genes\"` (list of gene_ids where mean expression > 0.7 after normalization).\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"

      "message": "Clarifying Column Meanings: I'm now focusing on the data's column structure. Specifically, I'm trying to resolve the ambiguity around \"samples.\" Does it imply multiple expression level columns for different samples, or is the `expression_level` column treated as the sole representation? I'm homing in on the meaning to facilitate the appropriate min-max normalization.\nRefining Sample Interpretation: I've decided to interpret \"samples\" as referring to a single sample, aligning with the presence of a lone `Expression Level` column. Consequently, I'm confident in setting `\"total_samples\": 1`. I'm now certain there is no scaling by the number of rows.\nCalculating Summary Statistics: I'm now in the midst of calculating the summary statistics from the data. Specifically, I am determining \"total_genes\" by taking the length of the cleaned DataFrame. I also have \"total_samples\" set to 1, as there is a single expression column. I'm calculating \"mean_expression\" using normalized values and gathering the \"highly_expressed_genes\" based on the normalized expression exceeding 0.7. I'm using `MinMaxScaler` for normalization. I'm now writing the Python code for this in a notebook.\nImplementing Data Filters: I've just added filters. I'm removing rows where the expression level is below 10.0 and converting the column names to a lowercase, snake_case format. Following filtering, I'm exporting a JSON and Excel file with the filtered data. Lastly, I'm now doing normalization and gathering summary statistics on the filtered and normalized data.\nRevisiting Normalization Strategy: Okay, I'm reconsidering the normalization process in light of the prompt, as well as the column specification in the requirements. Although the requirement focuses on a single `Expression Level`, I am thinking about how to generalize my approach. I've been considering explicitly checking which columns represent expression values to better handle potential future CSV variations with multiple samples. However, I've decided to adhere to the single `expression_level` column specified. I'm now certain this is appropriate.\nConfirming Sample Count: I'm verifying that with just one sample, \"total_samples\" remains 1, which aligns with the requirements. I'm double-checking the file specifications for the cleaned, filtered, and normalized data, confirming the paths and formats are correct. The normalization will directly modify the existing `expression_level` column in the filtered dataframe, before saving the normalized values to a CSV.\nDefining Mean Expression: I've determined that `mean_expression` is simply the average of the `expression_level` column, which is also the mean of all normalized values. This is based on the single `expression_level` column in the data. To be sure, I checked the input CSV and confirmed only 3 columns. I'm now structuring a Jupyter Notebook with a simple JSON object that can be read by a Jupyter environment, incorporating the Pandas import and CSV loading, as well as column standardization steps.\nImplementing Data Cleaning: I've just added the code for data cleaning! First, column names will be standardized to a lowercase snake_case format. Following this, I am filtering the data, removing rows where the 'expression_level' is below 10. I am also exporting the filtered data to JSON and Excel formats. After that, I will conduct normalization on the dataframe.\nFinalizing Summary Statistics: I've just finished calculating the final statistics. Specifically, I computed \"total_genes,\" the length of the normalized DataFrame, and confirmed \"total_samples\" is 1. I found the `mean_expression` using the normalized `expression_level` values, and I determined `highly_expressed_genes` based on a 0.7 threshold. I've exported a JSON file containing the calculated summary. Finally, I've exported the normalized data to CSV.",

I'm focusing on writing this code to `/home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb`.\nRefining Data Processing: I've moved on to refining the data processing steps. The code now standardizes column names to lowercase and replaces spaces and hyphens with underscores. I'm filtering the data to include only entries with an expression level of 10.0 or higher. The filtered data is then converted into JSON and Excel formats for export. Finally, I'm performing data normalization, and calculating and summarizing key statistics for the processed data.\nStructuring Notebook Cells: I'm now structuring the Jupyter Notebook into cells for clarity and execution. I've added Markdown cells to introduce the notebook and describe each processing step. Code cells are being generated to load the data, standardize column names, and filter the data based on expression levels. The goal is separate, well-documented cells for readability and maintainability, creating a structured notebook for data transformation. I'm focusing on ensuring each cell performs a specific task and provides useful output.\nFinalizing File Outputs: I'm now implementing the final file output stage. I've added a section that exports the filtered data to JSON and Excel formats, located at `/home/user/clean_genes.json` and `/home/user/clean_genes.xlsx` respectively. I'm also including a data normalization step with min-max scaling to create `/home/user/normalized_expression.csv` and a concise summary, all in individual notebook cells.",

My code, `df_norm[col] = (df_norm[col] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)`, directly implements the normalization requirement. This ensures the data is transformed as intended.\nVerifying File Output: I'm confident the output CSV contains only normalized expression data, addressing concerns about a new `normalized_expression` column. The instructions imply overwriting existing values, which I've confirmed. Additionally, I've verified that the `p_value` column name has been correctly transformed, confirming that the transformation steps meet the requirements.\nEvaluating Data Transformations: I've just finished filtering the data and confirmed the filtering logic keeps genes with expression levels of 10.0 or greater. After normalization, I now know how to correctly calculate the mean of the normalized data. I'm satisfied the script correctly identifies `GENE_4` as highly expressed and outputs the expected notebook files. I've confirmed that the generated notebook is called `gene_format_converter.nbconvert.ipynb`.\nRefining Notebook Execution: I'm now focusing on ensuring the notebook executes flawlessly using `nbconvert`. I've realized that the `display(df.head())` call could be problematic in certain non-interactive contexts. I'm updating the notebook to use `df.head()` instead, to eliminate any potential `NameError`.
