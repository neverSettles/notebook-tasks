We have a raw gene expression dataset in CSV format, but our pipelines require the data in JSON and Excel formats, and the dataset needs basic cleaning.\n\nWrite a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb` that performs the following steps in separate, well-documented cells:\n\n1. **Load Data**: Read the dataset from `/home/user/raw_genes.csv`.\n2. **Standardize Column Names**: Convert all column names to lowercase, replace spaces and hyphens with underscores. Specifically, the columns `Gene ID`, `Expression Level`, and `P-Value` should become `gene_id`, `expression_level`, and `p_value`.\n3. **Filter Data**: Remove any rows where `expression_level` is strictly less than 10.0.\n4. **Format Conversion & Export**: Save the cleaned and filtered DataFrame to two different formats:\n   - A JSON file at `/home/user/clean_genes.json` (use `orient='records'`).\n   - An Excel file at `/home/user/clean_genes.xlsx` (use `index=False`).\n\nMake sure the notebook runs without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb`.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Data Normalization and Summary:**\nAfter the format conversion:\n1. Normalize expression values per sample using min-max scaling (0-1 range per sample column).\n2. Save the normalized data to `/home/user/normalized_expression.csv`.\n3. Generate an executive summary JSON at `/home/user/expression_summary.json` with: `\"total_genes\"` (int), `\"total_samples\"` (int), `\"mean_expression\"` (float), `\"highly_expressed_genes\"` (list of gene_ids where mean expression > 0.7 after normalization).\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"
