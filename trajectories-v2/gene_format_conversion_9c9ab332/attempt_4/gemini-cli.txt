I have created the Jupyter Notebook according to your requirements and successfully executed it to generate all the necessary output files.

The notebook `/home/user/gene_format_converter.ipynb` has been structured with separate markdown and code cells to:
1. **Load Data:** Reads the original `/home/user/raw_genes.csv`.
2. **Standardize Column Names:** Formats the headers to lowercase with underscores (`gene_id`, `expression_level`, `p_value`).
3. **Filter Data:** Removes entries where `expression_level` is less than 10.0.
4. **Format Conversion & Export:** Saves the cleaned dataset into JSON (`/home/user/clean_genes.json`) and Excel (`/home/user/clean_genes.xlsx`) formats.
5. **Data Normalization & Summary:** Normalizes the remaining expression levels using min-max scaling (0-1), exports this to `/home/user/normalized_expression.csv`, and finally writes the requested executive summary parameters to `/home/user/expression_summary.json`.

All the output datasets, including the JSON summary, are now available in your home directory.
