          "text": "My colleague was working on a sales dashboard notebook, but they left the company. I need you to create a completely new Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/dashboard.ipynb` that processes the raw sales data and generates the required outputs. The data is messier now and involves multiple currencies.\n\nYou have two input files:\n1. `/home/user/sales_data.csv` (Columns: `Date`, `OrderID`, `Product`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `Currency`)\n2. `/home/user/exchange_rates.csv` (Columns: `Date`, `Currency`, `Rate_to_USD`)\n\nYour notebook must perform the following operations:\n1. **Data Cleaning**: \n   - Parse the `Date` columns in both files. The sales data might have mixed date formats. Convert them to `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Remove any rows from `sales_data.csv` where `Quantity <= 0` or `UnitPrice <= 0` (these are invalid or returns).\n   - Drop rows with missing values in `Quantity` or `UnitPrice`.\n\n2. **Currency Conversion**:\n   - Merge the sales data with the exchange rates. \n   - Note: The exchange rates are only provided for weekdays or specific dates. You must forward-fill missing exchange rates for each currency. If a sales date is before the first available exchange rate for a currency, back-fill it.\n   - Calculate a new column `USD_Revenue` = `Quantity * UnitPrice / Rate_to_USD`.\n\n3. **Aggregation**:\n   - Calculate total daily `USD_Revenue` for all products combined.\n   - Calculate a rolling 7-day average of the daily `USD_Revenue`. (For the first 6 days, the rolling average should be calculated using `min_periods=1`).\n   \n4. **Outputs**:\n   - Save the daily aggregated data to `/home/user/daily_sales.csv`. It must have exactly three columns: `Date`, `Daily_Revenue`, `Rolling_7d_Revenue`. The dates should be sorted chronologically. All float values should be rounded to 2 decimal places.\n   - Save a JSON file `/home/user/metrics.json` containing:\n     - `\"Total_USD_Revenue\"`: Total revenue across all valid rows (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n     - `\"Top_Product\"`: The name of the product with the highest total `USD_Revenue`.\n   - Create a plot of `Date` vs `Rolling_7d_Revenue` and save it as `/home/user/dashboard.png` using matplotlib or seaborn.\n\nThe notebook must be perfectly executable with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/dashboard.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/dashboard.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Metric calculation formulas:**\n- `Total_USD_Revenue`: Sum of (Quantity * UnitPrice * exchange_rate) for all orders. Use the exchange rates from `exchange_rates.csv`.\n- `Total_Orders`: Count of unique OrderIDs.\n- Daily sales in `daily_sales.csv` should aggregate USD revenue by Date.\n"

Rows missing `Quantity` or `UnitPrice` and rows where `Quantity <= 0` or `UnitPrice <= 0` were successfully filtered out.\n3. **Currency Conversion**: Generated a continuous daily date range, pivoted the exchange rates, and applied both forward-fill and back-fill logic per currency to handle missing dates. The formula `USD_Revenue = Quantity * UnitPrice / Rate_to_USD` was applied to normalized data.\n4. **Aggregation**: Rolled up revenue into a continuous daily timeline (handling days with no valid sales as zero revenue) and computed the 7-day rolling average using a window of 7 rows with `min_periods=1`.\n5. **Output Generation**:\n   - The aggregated daily sales data is saved at `/home/user/daily_sales.csv` with the specified columns (`Date`, `Daily_Revenue`, `Rolling_7d_Revenue`) and floats rounded to 2 decimal places.\n   - The high-level metrics are computed and saved to `/home/user/metrics.json` (calculating a total valid revenue of `4330.41` and recognizing `\"A\"` as the Top Product).\n   - The dashboard plot (`Date` vs `Rolling_7d_Revenue`) is visualized and saved at `/home/user/dashboard.png`.\n6. **Execution**: The notebook was actively run using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/dashboard.ipynb` to guarantee flawless execution and construct the final required artifacts.",
