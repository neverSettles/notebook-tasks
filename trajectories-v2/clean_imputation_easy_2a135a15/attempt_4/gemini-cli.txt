I will now create the Jupyter notebook with the required data cleaning, imputation, and outlier detection logic, and then execute it using `jupyter nbconvert`.

I will now execute the notebook using the `jupyter nbconvert` command to process the data and generate the output files.

I encountered a JSON format issue with the Jupyter notebook file. I will generate it robustly using the `nbformat` library to ensure it's structurally valid, and then execute it.

I will execute the notebook creation script and then run the generated notebook to fulfill all operations.

Let me check why the Python script encountered a syntax error and fix it.

I will fix the Python string syntax issue by using multi-line strings (triple quotes) and execute the creation process again.

I'm now running the corrected script to generate the JSON notebook file and trigger its execution to create the final data assets.

I will verify that the expected files (cleaned data, box plot, outlier report) have been successfully generated by the Jupyter notebook.

I will perform a final check on the contents of the generated `outlier_report.json` to ensure the calculations were correctly performed.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb` and executed it using `jupyter nbconvert`.

The execution has successfully processed the dataset and generated the requested files:
1.  **`/home/user/cleaned_financial_data.csv`:** The cleaned dataset with imputed values and calculated 'Profit'.
2.  **`/home/user/boxplot.png`:** The side-by-side box plot for 'Revenue' and 'Expenses'.
3.  **`/home/user/outlier_report.json`:** The JSON report detailing the outliers (0 detected), mean, and standard deviation for 'Revenue'.
