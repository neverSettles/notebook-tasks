I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the specified data cleaning, imputation, and outlier detection logic, and then execute it.

sI will now execute the notebook using the Jupyter nbconvert command to generate the cleaned dataset, the boxplot, and the outlier report.

sI will fix the formatting of the JSON structure within the notebook file, since it seems to have an invalid control character. I will use the `echo` command and a heredoc to safely write the JSON correctly, or generate a python script to convert to JSON safely.

sI will execute a Python script to robustly generate the notebook JSON file, and then run `jupyter nbconvert` to execute the notebook itself and ensure all requested outputs are created.

sThe JSON source string arrays contain literal newline characters which cause a SyntaxError in Python. Let me rewrite the code correctly using Python list literal syntax.

sI will execute the updated Python script to correctly generate the JSON structure and run the `jupyter nbconvert` command.

sI will verify that all expected output files have been correctly generated.

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook with your requested imputation and outlier logic, and executed it automatically. 

The following files have been generated:
- `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`: The notebook itself.
- `/home/user/cleaned_financial_data.csv`: The clean dataset with the `Date` index.
- `/home/user/boxplot.png`: The side-by-side boxplot.
- `/home/user/outlier_report.json`: The JSON report containing outlier statistics.
