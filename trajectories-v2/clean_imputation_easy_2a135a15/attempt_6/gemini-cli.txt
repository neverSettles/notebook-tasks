I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the required data cleaning, imputation, and outlier detection logic, and then execute it using `jupyter nbconvert`.

I will now run the newly created notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to execute the code and generate the required output files (`cleaned_financial_data.csv`, `boxplot.png`, and `outlier_report.json`).

I will investigate the JSON syntax error in the notebook file by reading it.

I see the issue. The newlines were literal rather than escaped, causing a JSON parse error. I will use a Python script to reliably generate and save the Jupyter Notebook format.

I will now execute the recreated notebook to perform the data cleaning, imputation, and generate the required files.

The notebook has successfully executed. I will quickly verify that all the required output files were generated.

The Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb` has been created and executed successfully. All required files, including the cleaned financial dataset, side-by-side boxplot, and the outlier report in JSON format, have been generated.
