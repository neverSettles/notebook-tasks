Load the dataset `/home/user/financial_data.csv` using pandas.\n2. Set the 'Date' column as the DataFrame index.\n3. Impute missing values in the 'Revenue' column using forward fill (`ffill()`).\n4. Impute missing values in the 'Expenses' column using the mean value of the 'Expenses' column.\n5. Calculate the 'Profit' column as 'Revenue' minus 'Expenses'.\n6. Save the cleaned DataFrame to `/home/user/cleaned_financial_data.csv` (keep the Date index).\n\nThe notebook must be perfectly executable with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Outlier Detection and Visualization:**\nAfter imputation and calculating Profit:\n1. Add a cell that detects outliers in the 'Revenue' column using the IQR method (values outside Q1-1.5*IQR to Q3+1.5*IQR).\n2. Save a box plot of Revenue and Expenses (side by side) to `/home/user/boxplot.png`.\n3. Save a JSON report at `/home/user/outlier_report.json` with keys: `\"n_revenue_outliers\"` (int), `\"revenue_mean\"` (float), `\"revenue_std\"` (float).\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"
