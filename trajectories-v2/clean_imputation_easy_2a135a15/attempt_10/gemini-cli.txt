I will create the Jupyter notebook that handles the dataset cleaning, imputation, outlier detection, and visualization as requested. Then, I will execute the notebook.

I will now execute the Jupyter notebook using `nbconvert` to generate the cleaned data, the outlier report, and the boxplot.

I will inspect the notebook file to see what caused the JSON decode error.

I will write a Python script to generate the Jupyter notebook properly formatted as valid JSON, then use the script to build the `.ipynb` file to ensure there are no parsing errors.

I will verify that all required outputs (the cleaned data, the outlier report, and the boxplot) were successfully generated.

I will inspect the contents of the generated files to ensure they meet the specific requirements, starting with the JSON outlier report.

I will check the cleaned financial data CSV to confirm the `Date` column is the index and that the `Revenue` and `Expenses` data were imputed correctly.

I will quickly clean up the temporary python script I used to build the notebook.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb` and executed it. 

The notebook handles:
1. Loading the financial dataset and setting the `Date` as the index.
2. Imputing `Revenue` using forward fill.
3. Imputing `Expenses` using the mean of the column.
4. Calculating `Profit`.
5. Saving the results to `/home/user/cleaned_financial_data.csv`.
6. Generating the boxplot for Revenue and Expenses and saving it to `/home/user/boxplot.png`.
7. Performing IQR-based outlier detection for Revenue and exporting the metrics to `/home/user/outlier_report.json`.

All required files, including the cleaned data, boxplot, and the outlier report have been successfully generated by the execution step.
