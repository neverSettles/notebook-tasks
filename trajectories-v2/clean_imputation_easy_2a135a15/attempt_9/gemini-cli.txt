I will first check the contents of the `financial_data.csv` file to verify the column names before writing and executing the Jupyter notebook.
I will create the Jupyter notebook that fulfills your requirements. Let me save the notebook code to `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`.
Now I will run the newly created notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to execute the code and generate the required output files (CSV, boxplot, and JSON report).
I need to check why the notebook format is invalid. I will read the first 20 lines of the notebook file I just created.
I will rewrite the Jupyter notebook by running a Python script to ensure the JSON format is correctly escaped and valid.

I will now verify that the expected files (cleaned dataset, boxplot image, and JSON outlier report) have been successfully generated.
I will quickly inspect the cleaned CSV output file to ensure the data imputation was successful and the format is correct.
I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook and executed it as requested. 

Here is what was accomplished:
1. Created `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb` with robust JSON formatting using a Python script.
2. The notebook loads the dataset `/home/user/financial_data.csv`, sets 'Date' as the index, forward fills missing `Revenue` data, imputes missing `Expenses` data using the mean, and calculates `Profit`. 
3. It saves the cleaned data back into `/home/user/cleaned_financial_data.csv`.
4. It performs outlier detection on the `Revenue` column using the IQR method, resulting in an output `outlier_report.json` with the required keys (`n_revenue_outliers`, `revenue_mean`, `revenue_std`).
5. A side-by-side boxplot of `Revenue` and `Expenses` is exported to `/home/user/boxplot.png`.
6. I ran the exact command `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`, which successfully compiled the outputs in your workspace.

The process is fully complete and all output files are now available in your directory!
