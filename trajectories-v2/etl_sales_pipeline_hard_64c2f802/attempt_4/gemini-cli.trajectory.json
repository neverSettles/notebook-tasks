          "text": "You are a Data Engineer building an ETL pipeline. \n\nI have two raw data files:\n1. `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`: Contains transactional data with columns `txn_date`, `store_id`, `item_code`, `revenue`, and `expenses`. \n   - `revenue` is stored as strings with currency symbols and commas (e.g., `\"$1,234.56\"`).\n   - `expenses` has some missing values (NaN).\n   - `txn_date` contains mixed date formats (e.g., `2023-01-15` and `01/15/2023`).\n2. `/home/user/store_regions.json`: A JSON file mapping `store_id` (string) to `region_name` (string).\n\nPlease create a Jupyter Notebook named `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that performs the following multi-step ETL process:\n\n1. **Extraction & Cleaning**:\n   - Load the CSV and JSON files.\n   - Parse `txn_date` into a standard pandas datetime format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).\n   - Clean the `revenue` column, converting it to a numeric float.\n   - Impute missing values in `expenses` with the median `expenses` for that specific `item_code`. If an item has no valid expenses at all, fill with 0.\n   \n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - Calculate a new column `profit` = `revenue - expenses`.\n   - Map `store_id` to `region_name` using the JSON data. For any `store_id` not found in the JSON, set `region_name` to `\"Unknown\"`.\n   - Filter the dataset to **exclude** any transactions where `profit < 0` (keep only zero or positive profit rows).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - Save the fully cleaned, merged, and filtered dataset to `/home/user/clean_data.csv` (do not include the pandas index).\n   - Create an Excel file `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx` containing two sheets:\n     - Sheet 1 named `\"Region_Profit\"`: Total profit per region, sorted by total profit in descending order. Columns must be `region_name`, `total_profit`.\n     - Sheet 2 named `\"Top_Items\"`: For each region, find the top 2 `item_code`s by total profit. Sort by `region_name` alphabetically, then by profit descending. Columns must be `region_name`, `item_code`, `item_profit`.\n\nThe notebook must be fully executable from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"
