I have created the Jupyter Notebook `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` with the required ETL steps and executed it to generate `/home/user/clean_data.csv` and `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx`. 

The notebook handles the unquoted commas in the `revenue` strings, computes the medians per item, filters out negative profits, and generates the aggregated Excel sheets precisely as requested.
