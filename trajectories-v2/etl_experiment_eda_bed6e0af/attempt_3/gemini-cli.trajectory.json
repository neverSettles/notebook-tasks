          "text": "You are a Data Engineer building an ETL pipeline to validate and analyze agricultural experiment data. We have two raw CSV files: `/home/user/plot_metadata.csv` and `/home/user/yield_data.csv`. \n\nCreate a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb` to perform systematic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning.\n\nYour notebook must accomplish the following steps in order:\n1. Load both CSV files and merge them on `plot_id` using an inner join.\n2. Clean the merged dataset by dropping rows with environmental anomalies. Specifically, remove any rows where `daily_temp` is greater than 50 or `daily_rainfall` is less than 0.\n3. Compute summary statistics grouped by `fertilizer`. Calculate the mean of `yield_kg` and `daily_temp` for each fertilizer type. Save these exact results as a JSON file at `/home/user/summary_stats.json`. The JSON should be a dictionary where keys are the fertilizer names (e.g., \"None\", \"F_A\") and values are dictionaries with keys `\"yield_kg\"` and `\"daily_temp\"` containing the mean values as floats.\n4. Generate a scatter plot with `daily_temp` on the x-axis and `yield_kg` on the y-axis. Save this plot as `/home/user/temp_vs_yield.png`.\n5. Save the cleaned, merged dataset to `/home/user/clean_experiment_data.csv` (include headers, do not include the index).\n6. **Validation Cells:** At the end of your notebook, add Python `assert` statements to validate the pipeline's correctness. Specifically, load `/home/user/clean_experiment_data.csv` and assert that:\n   - The dataframe has exactly 8 rows.\n   - The maximum `daily_temp` in the cleaned dataset is `<= 50`.\n   - The minimum `daily_rainfall` in the cleaned dataset is `>= 0`.\n\nThe notebook must execute successfully from top to bottom with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Expected JSON Structure for summary statistics:**\n```json\n{\n  \"Fertilizer_A\": {\"mean_yield\": <float>, \"std_yield\": <float>, \"count\": <int>},\n  \"Fertilizer_B\": {\"mean_yield\": <float>, \"std_yield\": <float>, \"count\": <int>},\n  \"Fertilizer_C\": {\"mean_yield\": <float>, \"std_yield\": <float>, \"count\": <int>}\n}\n```\nUse the exact fertilizer names from the dataset as keys.\n"

The\n           fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, \n           redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\n           names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\n           however, cannot be released under any other type of license.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\n              protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and\n              Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited\n              to, the following:\n              1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\n                 and translate a Work;\n              2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n              3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness\n                 depicted in a Work;\n              4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n                 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;\n              5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in\n                 a Work;\n              6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n                 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n                 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\n                 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n              7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\n                 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations\n                 thereof.\n         \n           2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n              applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n              unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n              and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n              known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n              action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n              duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n              makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n              to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n              such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n              termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n              enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n              Statement of Purpose.\n         \n           3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n              judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n              shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n              Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n              Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n              royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n              irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n              Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n              maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n              shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n              Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n              invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n              ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n              such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n              of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n              assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n              in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n         \n           4.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n         ==========================\n         \n         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\n         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\n         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\n         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n         \n         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\n         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\n         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\n         software.\n         \n         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\n         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\n         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\n         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\n         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\n         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\n         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n         \n         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\n         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\n         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\n         the various releases.\n         \n             Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                             from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n         \n         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n             is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n         \n         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\n         direction to make these releases possible.\n         \n         \n         B.

      -----------------------------------------------------------\n         \n           PREAMBLE\n           The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide\n           development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation\n           efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and\n           open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership\n           with others.\n         \n           The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and\n           redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The\n           fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, \n           redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\n           names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\n           however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The\n           requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply\n           to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n         \n           DEFINITIONS\n           \"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\n           Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may\n           include source files, build scripts and documentation.\n         \n           \"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the\n           copyright statement(s).\n         \n           \"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as\n           distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n         \n           \"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\n           or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\n           Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\n           new environment.\n         \n           \"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\n           writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\n         \n           PERMISSION & CONDITIONS\n           Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\n           a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\n           redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\n           Software, subject to the following conditions:\n         \n           1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\n           in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n         \n           2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\n           redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\n           contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be\n           included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\n           in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\n           binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n         \n           3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\n           Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\n           Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\n           presented to the users.\n         \n           4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\n           Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\n           Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\n           Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\n           permission.\n         \n           5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\n           must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\n           distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to\n           remain under this license does not apply to any document created\n           using the Font Software.\n         \n           TERMINATION\n           This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are\n           not met.\n         \n           DISCLAIMER\n           THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n           EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF\n           MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT\n           OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.

Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,\n              applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and\n              unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright\n              and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now\n              known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of\n              action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum\n              duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer\n              makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and\n              to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that\n              such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,\n              termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet\n              enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express\n              Statement of Purpose.\n         \n           3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be\n              judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver\n              shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account\n              Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the\n              Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a\n              royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\n              irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and\n              Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\n              maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time\n              extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of\n              copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation\n              commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License\n              shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the\n              Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally\n              invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or\n              ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in\n              such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any\n              of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)\n              assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,\n              in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.\n         \n           4.

Do NOT use `&` to background commands. Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

I explicitly handled the parsing of the `\"None\"` group so it wouldn't be mistakenly interpreted as a missing value (NaN).\n3. **Summary Statistics**: Statistics are computed for each fertilizer type and saved exactly as requested in `/home/user/summary_stats.json`. The JSON uses the exact string keys for the fertilizer names (`\"F_A\"`, `\"F_B\"`, `\"None\"`).\n4. **Scatter Plot**: A scatter plot of `daily_temp` versus `yield_kg` is generated and saved as `/home/user/temp_vs_yield.png`.\n5. **Clean Data Export**: The cleaned data is saved without its index to `/home/user/clean_experiment_data.csv`.\n6. **Validation Cells**: The bottom of the notebook contains Python `assert` statements to ensure the dataset holds exactly 8 rows and honors the anomaly filtering thresholds (`<= 50` temp, `>= 0` rainfall).\n\nThe notebook was successfully executed from top to bottom and all required files (`summary_stats.json`, `temp_vs_yield.png`, and `clean_experiment_data.csv`) were generated.",
