We have two raw CSV files: `/home/user/plot_metadata.csv` and `/home/user/yield_data.csv`. \n\nCreate a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb` to perform systematic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning.\n\nYour notebook must accomplish the following steps in order:\n1. Load both CSV files and merge them on `plot_id` using an inner join.\n2. Clean the merged dataset by dropping rows with environmental anomalies. Specifically, remove any rows where `daily_temp` is greater than 50 or `daily_rainfall` is less than 0.\n3. Compute summary statistics grouped by `fertilizer`. Calculate the mean of `yield_kg` and `daily_temp` for each fertilizer type. Save these exact results as a JSON file at `/home/user/summary_stats.json`. The JSON should be a dictionary where keys are the fertilizer names (e.g., \"None\", \"F_A\") and values are dictionaries with keys `\"yield_kg\"` and `\"daily_temp\"` containing the mean values as floats.\n4. Generate a scatter plot with `daily_temp` on the x-axis and `yield_kg` on the y-axis. Save this plot as `/home/user/temp_vs_yield.png`.\n5. Save the cleaned, merged dataset to `/home/user/clean_experiment_data.csv` (include headers, do not include the index).\n6. **Validation Cells:** At the end of your notebook, add Python `assert` statements to validate the pipeline's correctness. Specifically, load `/home/user/clean_experiment_data.csv` and assert that:\n   - The dataframe has exactly 8 rows.\n   - The maximum `daily_temp` in the cleaned dataset is `<= 50`.\n   - The minimum `daily_rainfall` in the cleaned dataset is `>= 0`.\n\nThe notebook must execute successfully from top to bottom with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_experiment_eda.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n\n**Expected JSON Structure for summary statistics:**\n```json\n{\n  \"Fertilizer_A\": {\"mean_yield\": <float>, \"std_yield\": <float>, \"count\": <int>},\n  \"Fertilizer_B\": {\"mean_yield\": <float>, \"std_yield\": <float>, \"count\": <int>},\n  \"Fertilizer_C\": {\"mean_yield\": <float>, \"std_yield\": <float>, \"count\": <int>}\n}\n```\nUse the exact fertilizer names from the dataset as keys.\n"
