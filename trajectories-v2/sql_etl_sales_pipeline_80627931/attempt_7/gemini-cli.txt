I have created the requested ETL pipeline as a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` and executed it successfully. 

The notebook seamlessly processes the data through the following steps:
1. Imports `pandas`, `sqlite3`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`.
2. Loads `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Loads the data into an in-memory SQLite database (`:memory:`) under the table name `sales`.
4. Executes a SQL query to compute `total_revenue` per region and ranks them using `RANK() OVER (...)`.
5. Exports the results to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`.
6. Calculates the running total of revenue per region using the `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount)` window function.
7. Exports these advanced analytics results to `/home/user/running_totals.csv`.
8. Generates a bar chart visualizing total revenue per region and saves it as `/home/user/revenue_chart.png`.

I also ran `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` to execute the pipeline directly, and successfully generated all the required output files in the `/home/user/` directory.
