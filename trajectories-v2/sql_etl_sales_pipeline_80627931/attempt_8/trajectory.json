I have a raw dataset located at `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\n\nCreate a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that performs the following steps:\n1. Import `pandas` and `sqlite3`.\n2. Load `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. Create an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`) and write the DataFrame to a table named `sales`.\n4. Execute a SQL query that calculates the total revenue (sum of `amount`) per `region`, and assigns a rank to each region based on their total revenue (highest revenue = rank 1). Use the `RANK()` window function.\n5. Save the result of this query to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index. \nThe output CSV must contain exactly three columns named: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.\n\nEnsure your notebook executes cleanly from top to bottom. Automated tests will run your notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` and check the contents of `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Advanced SQL Analysis:**\nAfter the basic ETL pipeline:\n1. Add a SQL query that calculates a running total of revenue per region (using `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount)`).\n2. Save the running total results to `/home/user/running_totals.csv` with columns: `region`, `amount`, `running_total`.\n3. Generate a bar chart comparing total revenue per region and save to `/home/user/revenue_chart.png`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"

      "reasoning_content": "Initiating ETL Pipeline: I'm now focused on the foundational task: constructing a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. My initial step involves loading the specified CSV file, `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`, into a Pandas DataFrame.\nRefining Data Processing: I've moved on to refining the data processing steps. The initial DataFrame is now stored in an in-memory SQLite database as the `sales` table. Next, I'm formulating an SQL query. This query calculates the total revenue per region, ranks the regions by revenue, and saves it to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`. I'm also preparing another SQL query to compute and save running totals for each region. Finally, I'll generate a revenue bar chart and store it for visualization. I'll execute the whole notebook at the end to generate the output files.\nStructuring Notebook Creation: I'm now contemplating how to construct the Jupyter Notebook's underlying JSON structure. I'm oscillating between generating the notebook via `nbformat`, directly crafting the JSON, or writing a Python script to do it. While direct JSON creation is tempting for simplicity, I think a Python script leveraging `nbformat` offers the best balance of readability and control, especially given the JSON quoting complexity I can anticipate. I'm focusing on ensuring column names from the raw CSV can be correctly mapped.\nSimplifying Script Generation: I've decided to streamline notebook creation. Instead of using `nbformat`, I'll use the `json` module within a Python script to build the notebook's structure directly. I've written out the python code that will go inside the notebook, which first loads the CSV, then creates an in-memory SQLite database. Then, the code executes SQL queries to calculate total revenue per region, ranks the regions by revenue, and saves the result to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`. I've also included comments in the script to reflect the prompts.\nImplementing Running Totals: I'm now implementing running totals using `SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY amount)` in my SQL query.  I've added code to calculate and save these running totals to `/home/user/running_totals.csv`. Additionally, I'm generating a bar chart of total revenue per region and saving it as `/home/user/revenue_chart.png`.  The script is progressing well; I'm generating the `.ipynb` file using a Python script that utilizes the `json` module, making the notebook structure more explicit.\nFinalizing Revenue Calculations: I've just added the remaining SQL clause, grouping the results by region. I'm now completing the SQL query to calculate the total revenue and ranking it by sales. My immediate focus is on ensuring the query structure is correct. I am planning on executing the notebook to verify results.\nVerifying Query Structure: I've just added the `GROUP BY region` clause to my SQL query, finalizing the calculation of total revenue and its ranking by sales. I'm focusing on ensuring the query structure's accuracy. I'm planning a notebook execution for result verification. I've also just implemented the final touches in regards to the bar chart, with a `matplotlib` figure size of 10x6.\nGenerating Notebook Execution: I've incorporated the chart customization code into the notebook generation script, setting the y-axis label to \"Total Revenue\" and adding a title and layout adjustments. Also, I've set the figure size to 10x6. The final output is an `.ipynb` file that's ready to be executed via `jupyter nbconvert`. I'm now testing the ETL pipeline.\nExecuting Notebook Generation: I've decided to bypass the intermediate script and directly construct the JSON payload for `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. This is faster. I've started building the JSON structure now, preparing for the `write_file` operation and defining the code cells. I am beginning with loading the CSV and creating an in-memory SQLite database, which I'll test via the shell after I write it.\nConfirming Calculations: I'm now verifying the calculations. I've focused on confirming the SQL queries for total revenue, ranking, and running totals, ensuring that the `GROUP BY region` clause is correctly implemented. I also confirm the output structure of the `clean_sales_df` and `running_totals_df` dataframes. I'll execute the notebook to validate the queries and data. I've also implemented the chart's final touches.\nValidating Final Outputs: Now I'm focusing on the final outputs and column names, making certain they align perfectly with the specifications. I have written the final notebook, ensuring the SQL queries and their resulting column names are exactly as specified. I am validating that `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` contains only the `region` and `total_revenue` columns, without the index. I also plan to verify the contents of `/home/user/running_totals.csv` and `/home/user/revenue_chart.png`.",

My focus now is on creating the notebook by formatting the Python code into JSON format. I will start by writing the Python code, for the initial import of `pandas`.\nConstructing Initial Notebook: I'm now writing the Python code directly. I've imported `pandas`, `sqlite3`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` and read the `raw_sales.csv` file into a DataFrame. Next, I'll create an in-memory SQLite database and write the data. After that, I will create queries and start cleaning the data and getting charts. I am confident I'm on the right track!\nGenerating Revenue Chart: I've written the Python code to generate a bar chart showing total revenue per region, and save it as `/home/user/revenue_chart.png`. I will now write the corresponding notebook to `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` by converting the code to JSON. I will then perform the conversion and write the file. I am not overly worried about missing libraries, because the image generation itself will fail in the notebook if `matplotlib` isn't installed.\nCalculating Running Total: I've crafted Python code to calculate total revenue, rank regions by sales, and compute a running total of revenue per region. I wrote the SQL queries to get the totals and rankings. Now, I'm integrating this with the data and writing it to a CSV. Next, I am thinking of adding code to compute a running total.\nFinalizing CSV Output: I've written and tested the code that computes running totals by region using SQL, and saved them to a CSV. Now, the next step is to incorporate these results with the earlier data, producing a final, clean file that integrates all analyses. I'm focusing on the integration aspect.\nDefining Notebook Parameters: I've determined the notebook's essential metadata: using the IPython mode for code input, a `.py` file extension, and specifying Python as the language with version 3.8.0. I am also utilizing the `nbconvert_exporter` which will render the code. The notebook format is nbformat 4.",
