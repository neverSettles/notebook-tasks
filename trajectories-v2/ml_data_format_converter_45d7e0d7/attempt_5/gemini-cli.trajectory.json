Your task is to create a clean, well-documented Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb` that batch loads, merges, and converts these files into a single CSV for model training.\n\nThe environment contains three raw data files:\n1. `/home/user/store_data.csv` (contains `store_id`, `store_type`, `profit_label`)\n2. `/home/user/region_data.json` (contains `store_id`, `region`)\n3. `/home/user/product_data.xlsx` (contains `store_id`, `top_category`)\n\nYour notebook must do the following in separate, clearly defined cells:\n1. **Data Loading:** Load all three files using Pandas.\n2. **Data Merging:** Merge the three DataFrames on `store_id` using an inner join.\n3. **Data Cleaning:** Sort the merged DataFrame by `store_id` in ascending order.\n4. **Export:** Save the final merged DataFrame to `/home/user/ml_training_data.csv` without the index.\n\nThe notebook must execute successfully with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb`.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Feature Analysis and Train/Test Split:**\nAfter merging the data files:\n1. Calculate the correlation matrix for all numeric columns and save a heatmap to `/home/user/correlation_heatmap.png`.\n2. Perform a stratified train/test split (80/20) based on the target variable, using `random_state=42`.\n3. Save `train.csv` and `test.csv` to `/home/user/`.\n4. Save a JSON report at `/home/user/split_report.json` with: `\"train_size\"` (int), `\"test_size\"` (int), `\"n_features\"` (int), `\"correlation_max\"` (float, highest absolute correlation between non-identical features).\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"

Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

It is organized into clear sections with markdown headers mapping to each operation.\n2.  **Data Operations**: \n    - Loads data from `store_data.csv`, `region_data.json`, and `product_data.xlsx`.\n    - Inner merges them iteratively on `store_id`.\n    - Sorts the final dataset by `store_id` (ascending).\n    - Exports it to `/home/user/ml_training_data.csv` without indexing.\n3.  **Feature Analysis & Modeling Readiness**:\n    - Calculates correlations across all numerical columns and saves a Seaborn heatmap to `/home/user/correlation_heatmap.png`.\n    - Splits the merged dataset into `train.csv` and `test.csv` (80/20 proportion based on the `profit_label` target using `random_state=42`). A fallback handling mechanism was also provided to safely avoid sklearn size mismatch errors in cases where the stratification splits a single sample test block across multiple classes (as the default dummy data only had 5 rows).\n    - Writes out `/home/user/split_report.json` containing `\"train_size\"`, `\"test_size\"`, the `\"n_features\"` count, and the computed `\"correlation_max\"` between non-target numeric features.\n4.  **Verification**: After generation, I verified the entire pipeline's logic by successfully running `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb`. All expected output files are correctly present in the home directory.",
