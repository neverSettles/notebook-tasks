Your task is to create a clean, well-documented Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb` that batch loads, merges, and converts these files into a single CSV for model training.\n\nThe environment contains three raw data files:\n1. `/home/user/store_data.csv` (contains `store_id`, `store_type`, `profit_label`)\n2. `/home/user/region_data.json` (contains `store_id`, `region`)\n3. `/home/user/product_data.xlsx` (contains `store_id`, `top_category`)\n\nYour notebook must do the following in separate, clearly defined cells:\n1. **Data Loading:** Load all three files using Pandas.\n2. **Data Merging:** Merge the three DataFrames on `store_id` using an inner join.\n3. **Data Cleaning:** Sort the merged DataFrame by `store_id` in ascending order.\n4. **Export:** Save the final merged DataFrame to `/home/user/ml_training_data.csv` without the index.\n\nThe notebook must execute successfully with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb`.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Feature Analysis and Train/Test Split:**\nAfter merging the data files:\n1. Calculate the correlation matrix for all numeric columns and save a heatmap to `/home/user/correlation_heatmap.png`.\n2. Perform a stratified train/test split (80/20) based on the target variable, using `random_state=42`.\n3. Save `train.csv` and `test.csv` to `/home/user/`.\n4. Save a JSON report at `/home/user/split_report.json` with: `\"train_size\"` (int), `\"test_size\"` (int), `\"n_features\"` (int), `\"correlation_max\"` (float, highest absolute correlation between non-identical features).\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"
