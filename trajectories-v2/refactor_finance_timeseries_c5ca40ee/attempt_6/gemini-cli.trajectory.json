You have an existing Python script (`/home/user/process_finance.py`) that reads a wide-format CSV of stock prices, melts it into a long format, calculates the average price per ticker, and saves the results.\n\nYour task is to convert this script into a clean, structured Jupyter notebook named `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`.\n\nRequirements for the notebook:\n1. Create exactly 3 code cells:\n   - Cell 1: Import pandas and load the data (`stocks.csv`).\n   - Cell 2: Melt the DataFrame from wide to long format (Date, Ticker, Price).\n   - Cell 3: Group by Ticker, calculate the mean 'Price', and save to `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` (without the index).\n\nExecute the notebook to ensure it generates `avg_prices.csv` successfully. Ensure your notebook is valid JSON and runs without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Trend Analysis and Visualization:**\nAfter computing average prices:\n1. Calculate a 2-period moving average of prices for each ticker.\n2. Save a line chart showing raw prices and moving averages per ticker to `/home/user/price_trends.png`.\n3. Save a trend analysis JSON at `/home/user/trend_analysis.json` with one entry per ticker: `{\"<ticker>\": {\"avg_price\": <float>, \"price_trend\": \"up\"|\"down\"|\"flat\", \"volatility\": <float_std_dev>}}`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"
