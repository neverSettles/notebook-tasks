          "text": "You are a Business Analyst preparing a quarterly performance report. Part of this report requires analyzing customer feedback, but the raw text data is messy. \n\nYour task is to create a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/quarterly_feedback_cleaning.ipynb` that cleans this text data and saves the result. \n\nAn input file named `/home/user/raw_feedback.csv` will be available with two columns: `id` and `feedback`.\n\nIn your notebook, perform the following steps:\n1. Load the `raw_feedback.csv` dataset using pandas.\n2. Create a new column called `cleaned_feedback` by applying the following text cleaning steps to the `feedback` column (in this order):\n   - Convert all text to lowercase.\n   - Strip all HTML tags (e.g., `<p>`, `</div>`, `<b>`) using regular expressions.\n   - Normalize Unicode characters to remove accents (e.g., \"café\" becomes \"cafe\"). Use `unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', text).encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('utf-8')`.\n   - Remove all punctuation (using `string.punctuation`).\n   - Remove the following predefined stopwords: `[\"the\", \"is\", \"a\", \"an\", \"and\", \"but\", \"or\", \"to\", \"this\", \"it\", \"in\", \"of\"]`. (Tokens should be separated by whitespace).\n3. Add a validation cell with `assert` statements to verify the processing works correctly. Specifically, assert that the cleaned text for `id == 2` is exactly `\"product risque love\"`.\n4. Save the resulting dataframe (keeping both the `id` and `cleaned_feedback` columns) to `/home/user/cleaned_feedback.csv`.\n\nEnsure your notebook executes sequentially without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_feedback_cleaning.ipynb`. Do not use external libraries like `nltk` or `spacy` that require internet downloads; rely on standard Python libraries like `re`, `string`, `unicodedata`, and `pandas`.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_feedback_cleaning.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"
