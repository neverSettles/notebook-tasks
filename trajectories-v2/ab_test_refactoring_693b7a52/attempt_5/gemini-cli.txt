I will create the structured Jupyter notebook from the script and run it to produce the needed files.
I will now execute the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to generate the required output files (`conversion_plot.png` and `summary_stats.csv`).
I will use a short Python script to programmatically build and save the notebook. This avoids any JSON formatting issues with the API.
Now I will try executing the notebook again.
I will now verify that the required output files were successfully created.
I will check the content of `summary_stats.csv` to ensure it meets the requirements.
I have successfully converted the `messy_ab_test.py` script into a well-structured Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`.

The new notebook is broken down into 6 distinct logical sections:
1. Import Libraries
2. Data Loading
3. Data Preprocessing & Summary
4. Statistical Testing
5. Visualization
6. Export Results

I have also executed the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`, which successfully generated the expected output files:
- `/home/user/conversion_plot.png`
- `/home/user/summary_stats.csv` (with the required columns: `group`, `Total_Visitors`, `Converted`, `Conversion_Rate`)
