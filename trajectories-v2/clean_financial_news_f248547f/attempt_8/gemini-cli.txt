I have created the Jupyter notebook with the required four cells to process the data according to your specifications. I also executed it using the provided command, which successfully generated the `cleaned_news.csv` file without any errors. 

The notebook handles the stopwords and text cleaning perfectly and saves the DataFrame containing the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns (without the index) as expected.
