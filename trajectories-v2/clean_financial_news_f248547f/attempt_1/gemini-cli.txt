I will create the Jupyter notebook with the requested data cleaning steps and then execute it to generate the output files.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook. I will now execute it to generate the `cleaned_news.csv` file.

I will write a Python script to properly generate the Jupyter notebook structure and avoid formatting issues.

I will now execute the python script to generate the notebook properly, then run the notebook to generate the cleaned data output.

I will use `python3` to run the script since `python` was not found.

I will verify if the execution produced the requested output file.

I will verify the contents of the generated `cleaned_news.csv` file to ensure the data processing was correctly applied.

I will verify the contents of the original `financial_news.csv` to ensure our logic covers all cases correctly.

I will tidy up the workspace by removing the temporary python script.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb` with all the specified data cleaning steps. 

I then executed the notebook exactly as you requested using `jupyter nbconvert`, which successfully processed the data from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` and generated the correctly formatted `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` file without the index. All your requirements have been met.
