I'll check the structure of the input data first to ensure I write the correct SQL queries and pandas code for the notebook.
Let's see the full span of the data to make sure I compute the quarter-over-quarter growth properly.
I'll create a script to generate the Jupyter notebook `quarterly_report.ipynb` containing all the requested data processing, SQL execution, and visualization steps.
Now I will run the python script to generate the Jupyter Notebook file.
Next, I'll execute the newly created notebook using jupyter nbconvert to run the code cells, perform calculations, and generate the requested output files.
Let's verify that the notebook execution has successfully created all the expected output files.
I'll check the content of the generated summary files to ensure the business logic executed correctly.
I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter Notebook as requested.

Here is a summary of the actions taken:
1. **Created `quarterly_report.ipynb`**: Using a Python script, I built the notebook ensuring it fulfills all requirements:
   - Data is loaded from `raw_sales.csv`.
   - Data is inserted into `sales.db` using `sqlite3`.
   - A SQL query computes total revenue, grouped alphabetically by region.
   - The results are saved to `revenue_report.csv` without indices.
   - A bar chart plotting regional revenue is generated and saved as `revenue_plot.png`.
   - Q-o-Q growth percentages are computed, and key metrics are written into `executive_summary.json`.
   - A Markdown cell titled `## Executive Summary` detailing findings is added at the end.
2. **Executed the Notebook**: I ran the exact command `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`.
3. **Validated the Output**: The notebook successfully generated all artifacts (`sales.db`, `revenue_report.csv`, `revenue_plot.png`, and `executive_summary.json`).

The task is complete and all requested files exist in your workspace.
