Make sure to execute the notebook once you create it (e.g., using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`).\n\n1. **Load Data**: Read the dataset from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`. \n2. **Database Setup**: Use the `sqlite3` library to create a SQLite database file at `/home/user/sales.db` and load the pandas DataFrame into a table named `sales`.\n3. **SQL Reporting**: Write and execute a SQL query using `pandas.read_sql` against the `sales` table to calculate the total revenue grouped by `region`. Order the results alphabetically by `region`.\n4. **Export Data**: Save the resulting DataFrame from the query to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` without the index. The columns must be exactly `region` and `total_revenue`.\n5. **Visualization**: Create a simple bar chart of the total revenue by region using matplotlib or seaborn. Save the plot as `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.\n\nThe input file `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` is already provided in the environment.\n\n\n**Additional Requirement - Growth Analysis and Executive Summary:**\nAfter creating the quarterly report:\n1. Calculate quarter-over-quarter revenue growth percentage for each region.\n2. Save an executive summary JSON at `/home/user/executive_summary.json` with: `\"total_revenue\"` (float), `\"top_region\"` (string, region with highest revenue), `\"n_regions\"` (int), `\"has_growth\"` (boolean, whether any region showed positive growth).\n3. Add a markdown cell at the end of the notebook titled \"## Executive Summary\" that describes the key findings.\n\n**IMPORTANT: After creating the notebook, you must run it to generate the output files.** Execute the notebook using:\n```bash\njupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb\n```\nThe tests check for output files that are only created when the notebook is executed. Creating the notebook alone is not sufficient.\n"

Now I understand that the tester will be using the `nbconvert` command to *execute* the notebook, relying on its side-effects of generating the other files. So I do not need to delete the `.nbconvert.ipynb` file. I'm also confirming the format of the markdown cell header. I am making sure the \"title\" is correctly described.",

It's clear I need to ensure the `revenue_report.csv` file gets generated, as it is based on the SQL query. The visualization using `matplotlib` to create `revenue_plot.png` also looks crucial, so I'm paying close attention to that part. I'm taking time to grasp the quarterly revenue calculations, especially the year-over-year growth aspect within the pandas operations, to determine their dependencies.",
