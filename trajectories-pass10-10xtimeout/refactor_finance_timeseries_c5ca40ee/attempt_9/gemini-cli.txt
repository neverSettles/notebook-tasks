I have successfully converted the Python script into a structured Jupyter Notebook with exactly three cells as requested, and executed it to confirm that the `avg_prices.csv` is correctly generated.

1. **Created notebook:** `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb` with three distinct cells for importing/loading, melting, and calculating/saving the mean prices.
2. **Executed notebook:** Used `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb` ensuring the JSON is valid and the notebook runs without errors.
3. **Verified output:** The resulting `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` was successfully saved with the correct grouped prices.
