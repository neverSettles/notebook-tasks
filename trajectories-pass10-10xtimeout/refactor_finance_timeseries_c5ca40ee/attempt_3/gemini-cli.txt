I will start by reading the contents of `process_finance.py` to understand the exact logic used for melting and aggregating the stock data.
I am creating the new Jupyter notebook with the split logic spread across three distinct code cells, as requested.
I will now execute the newly created notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to verify that it correctly calculates and generates the `avg_prices.csv` file.
I encountered a JSON formatting error due to escape characters. I will regenerate the notebook file using a Python script to ensure perfectly valid JSON structure.
I will now execute the recreated notebook file with `jupyter nbconvert` to verify it correctly processes the data and generates the new `avg_prices.csv` output file.
I am checking the contents of the generated `avg_prices.csv` file to ensure the calculations completed successfully and match our expectations.
I have successfully converted your Python script into the requested Jupyter Notebook (`finance_analysis.ipynb`) and verified its execution. 

Here are the actions completed:
1. Created `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb` with exactly 3 code cells:
   - **Cell 1**: Imports pandas and loads `stocks.csv`.
   - **Cell 2**: Melts the dataframe from wide to long format.
   - **Cell 3**: Groups by ticker, calculates the mean price, and saves the output to `avg_prices.csv` without an index.
2. Formatted the notebook strictly as valid JSON.
3. Executed the notebook locally using `jupyter nbconvert`. The process ran successfully without errors and correctly generated the `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` output file.
