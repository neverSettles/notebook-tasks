I have successfully converted the Python script into a structured Jupyter notebook meeting all your requirements.

The new notebook `/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb` contains exactly three cells:
1. Imports `pandas` and loads `stocks.csv`.
2. Melts the wide DataFrame into a long format using 'Date', 'Ticker', and 'Price'.
3. Groups the data by 'Ticker' to calculate the mean 'Price' and exports it to `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` without the index.

I also verified that the notebook is valid JSON and executes flawlessly using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`, properly generating the `avg_prices.csv` output file.
