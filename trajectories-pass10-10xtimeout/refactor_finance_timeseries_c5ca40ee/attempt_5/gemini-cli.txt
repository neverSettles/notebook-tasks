I'll start by reading the existing Python script to see how the data processing is currently implemented.
I will now write the Jupyter notebook containing the 3 required code cells and then execute it to generate the output CSV file.
I will execute the newly created notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to test that it processes the data and generates the CSV correctly.
I will use a short Python script to programmatically create the Jupyter notebook JSON structure. This prevents potential issues with hidden control characters in manual JSON creation and guarantees proper escaping.
I will now execute the dynamically generated Jupyter notebook to verify its logic and produce the average prices CSV.
I will verify that the notebook successfully wrote the output file by listing the contents of the generated CSV.
I'll refine the notebook's source cells to match exactly with the original script's relative file path for `stocks.csv`.
I will execute the updated notebook from the `/home/user` directory to guarantee that relative paths resolve correctly and the process succeeds.
I have successfully converted the Python script into a structured Jupyter notebook (`/home/user/finance_analysis.ipynb`) containing exactly 3 code cells as requested. The notebook is fully compliant with JSON constraints and executes seamlessly with `jupyter nbconvert`, correctly generating the final `/home/user/avg_prices.csv` output.
