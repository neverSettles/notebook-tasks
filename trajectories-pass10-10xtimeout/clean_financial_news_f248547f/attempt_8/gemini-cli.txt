I will create the Jupyter Notebook file at the requested path with the correct cell structure and code logic to clean the financial news data.

I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`. It contains four sequentially executable cells that import the necessary libraries, define your custom stopword list, apply the text cleaning logic to the `headline` column, and export the filtered data to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without an index.
