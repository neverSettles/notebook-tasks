I have created the Jupyter notebook with the data cleaning process exactly as requested. It is located at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`.

The notebook includes 4 cells configured as follows:
1. **Cell 1**: Imports `pandas` and `re`, and sets up the custom stopword list.
2. **Cell 2**: Loads the dataset from `/home/user/financial_news.csv`.
3. **Cell 3**: Defines a cleaning function that lowercases the text, removes punctuation with a regex (`[^a-z0-9\s]`), filters out the stopwords, and joins the words back together to create the new `cleaned_headline` column.
4. **Cell 4**: Filters the DataFrame to only include `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price`, and saves it to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without an index.

You can open the notebook in Jupyter or your preferred IDE to execute it.
