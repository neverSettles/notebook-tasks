The notebook should read `/home/user/financial_news.csv`.\n\nHere is what the notebook needs to do:\n1. **Cell 1**: Import pandas and re. Define a custom stopword list: `['the', 'a', 'an', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'for', 'to', 'of', 'and', 'is', 'are']`.\n2. **Cell 2**: Load the data from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. **Cell 3**: Create a new column called `cleaned_headline`. To create this, process the `headline` column as follows:\n   - Convert all text to lowercase.\n   - Remove all punctuation (keep only lowercase letters `a-z`, digits `0-9`, and spaces).\n   - Split the text by spaces, and remove any words that exactly match the custom stopword list.\n   - Join the remaining words back together with a single space.\n4. **Cell 4**: Keep only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns. Save the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` (do not include the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook can be executed sequentially from start to finish without errors."

      "message": "Defining the Notebook's Purpose: I'm now zeroing in on the core objective: crafting a Jupyter Notebook to transform financial news data. The target is clear \u2013 an input CSV file needs processing, and a new CSV containing the cleaned data is required as the output. The specifics of the cleaning process are yet to be addressed, but the destination and sources are fixed.\nStructuring the Notebook: I've outlined the notebook's structure now. I'll begin with importing `pandas` and `re`, then establishing my custom stopword list. Cell 2 will handle loading the CSV data. Following that, I'll create the `cleaned_headline` column, detailing the lowercase, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and rejoining stages within Cell 3. Finally, Cell 4 will focus on saving the cleaned data. I also defined the basic Jupyter Notebook file format and its internal structure for each cell.\nImplementing the Code: I've now translated the intended cell structure into actual Python code. Cell 1 successfully imports `pandas` and `re`, alongside the stopword list. Cell 2 is implemented to load the CSV, while Cell 3 is operational, defining and applying the `clean_text` function to generate the `cleaned_headline` column, handling potential non-string values gracefully. Cell 4, so far, has also been created to save the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns into a new file.\nFinalizing the Implementation: I've completed coding the `clean_text` function to handle data cleaning within the notebook. I've now integrated handling non-string inputs and applied the function to create the `cleaned_headline` column, handling potential non-string values gracefully. The next step is writing out the csv using the specified path. Finally, I'm working on formatting the JSON output, which reflects the notebook's structure, including code cells, their content, and metadata.\nValidating the Cleaning Function: I've tested the `clean_text` function with various inputs, ensuring it correctly lowercases, removes punctuation, and filters stopwords. I'm now focusing on the data loading cell, confirming the correct input file is used and verified the output format. I'm satisfied that each cell successfully runs in the notebook, so I have no need to refactor the code.",
