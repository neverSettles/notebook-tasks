The notebook should read `/home/user/financial_news.csv`.\n\nHere is what the notebook needs to do:\n1. **Cell 1**: Import pandas and re. Define a custom stopword list: `['the', 'a', 'an', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'for', 'to', 'of', 'and', 'is', 'are']`.\n2. **Cell 2**: Load the data from `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. **Cell 3**: Create a new column called `cleaned_headline`. To create this, process the `headline` column as follows:\n   - Convert all text to lowercase.\n   - Remove all punctuation (keep only lowercase letters `a-z`, digits `0-9`, and spaces).\n   - Split the text by spaces, and remove any words that exactly match the custom stopword list.\n   - Join the remaining words back together with a single space.\n4. **Cell 4**: Keep only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns. Save the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` (do not include the index).\n\nMake sure the notebook can be executed sequentially from start to finish without errors."

      "message": "Defining the Objective: I'm currently focused on defining the project's core objective: creating and executing a Jupyter notebook to clean financial news data. The target data file and notebook location have been specified, and I'm now drilling down into the specific requirements to ensure a smooth workflow. I'm prioritizing sequential execution within the notebook for clarity and reproducibility.\nConstructing the Notebook: I've moved on to drafting the Jupyter Notebook's JSON structure. Cell 1 will import `pandas` and `re`, defining `custom_stopwords`. Cell 2 will load the CSV, and Cell 3 is dedicated to cleaning the 'headline' data. This cell will lowercase, remove punctuation, exclude stopwords, and re-join the words. Cell 4 will save the cleaned data.\nRefining the Code: I'm now integrating the Python code snippets into the notebook's structure. Cell 2 loads the CSV file. In Cell 3, I've incorporated the `clean_text` function to process the 'headline' column. This includes lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords (using the `custom_stopwords` list), and rejoining the words. Cell 4 saves the 'date', 'cleaned_headline', and 'price' columns to a new CSV.\nImplementing the Core Logic: I'm now focused on implementing the core data cleaning logic within the Jupyter notebook. I've started incorporating the necessary Python code snippets. Specifically, I am importing `pandas` and `re` and defining the `custom_stopwords`. Subsequently I'm loading the CSV file. I'm moving on to implementing the `clean_text` function.\nFinalizing the Output: I'm now writing the final cell to create `df_final` with 'date', 'cleaned_headline', and 'price'. This data will then be saved to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without an index. I need to ensure this is properly formatted as a valid JSON structure before proceeding. Specifically I'm re-reviewing Cell 3 to make sure I followed the correct order of data cleaning.\nRefining the Text Cleaning: I've been honing the data cleaning within Cell 3, focusing on text processing logic. I've re-reviewed my strategy and decided that incorporating the `process_headline` is a good choice. I'm making sure to manage `NaN` values, and now I'm building out the string I'll write into the Jupyter notebook file.\nIntegrating the Code: I'm now integrating the Python code into the notebook's structure, specifically focusing on data cleaning. I'm focusing on incorporating a `clean_headline` function. This function lowercases text, removes punctuation, filters out stopwords, and rejoins the words. I'm also handling NaN values.\nVerifying the Notebook: I've just finished a final verification pass, confirming all requirements. I've double-checked the notebook's location and ensured that each cell performs its specified function. I've re-examined the code in Cell 3 that cleans the headline data, and now, finally, all checks are green! I'm ready for the next phase.",
