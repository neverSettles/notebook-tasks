I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb` according to your requirements. 

It contains the 4 requested cells and is structured to process the data sequentially:
1. Imports `pandas`, `re`, and defines the exact `stopwords` list.
2. Loads `/home/user/financial_news.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Defines a function to clean the `headline` column (converts to lowercase, removes punctuation, filters out stopwords) and creates the new `cleaned_headline` column.
4. Keeps only the `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns, and saves the cleaned dataset to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without the index. 

You can now open and execute this notebook sequentially from start to finish.
