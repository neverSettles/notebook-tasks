I will now create the Jupyter notebook with the required data cleaning cells.
I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/clean_analysis.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been structured with the 4 requested cells:
1. Imports `pandas` and `re`, and defines your custom stopword list.
2. Loads the `/home/user/financial_news.csv` dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Defines a cleaning function and applies it to create the `cleaned_headline` column, handling lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, and stopword exclusion.
4. Filters the DataFrame to keep only `date`, `cleaned_headline`, and `price` columns, saving the output to `/home/user/cleaned_news.csv` without an index. 

You can now open it in Jupyter and run the cells sequentially without errors.
