I will write a Jupyter notebook containing the specified pipeline to load, merge, clean, and export the data, and then I will execute it.

I will now execute the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to test the pipeline and generate the combined CSV file.

I encountered an issue generating a valid JSON format for the Jupyter notebook file. I will use a Python script to build and serialize the notebook correctly.

I will now execute the corrected notebook using `jupyter nbconvert` to test the pipeline.

I will verify the final CSV was created and contains the correct structure as expected by your model training.

The Jupyter notebook `/home/user/clean_pipeline.ipynb` has been successfully created and executed. 

The pipeline performs the following steps in clearly defined cells:
1. **Data Loading**: Loads the `.csv`, `.json`, and `.xlsx` files into Pandas DataFrames.
2. **Data Merging**: Performs an inner join across all three datasets on `store_id`.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Sorts the combined dataset in ascending order by `store_id`.
4. **Export**: Saves the unified dataset to `/home/user/ml_training_data.csv` without an index.

I verified the execution and the target ML training dataset has been successfully generated and is ready for use.
