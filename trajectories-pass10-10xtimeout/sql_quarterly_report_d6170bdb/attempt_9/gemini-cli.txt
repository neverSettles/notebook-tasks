I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter notebook to prepare the quarterly performance report.

Here is a summary of the completed steps:
1. **Notebook Creation:** Created `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`.
2. **Data & Database Setup:** The notebook loads `raw_sales.csv` using `pandas` and writes it to a new SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db` under the table name `sales`.
3. **SQL Aggregation:** It runs a SQL query with `pandas.read_sql()` to calculate the `total_revenue` by `region` (ordered alphabetically).
4. **Export:** The resulting grouped data was exported without an index to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` with the exact columns requested. 
5. **Visualization:** A bar chart mapping total revenue by region was generated via `matplotlib` and saved to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

The notebook has also been automatically executed and evaluated, meaning all of its code cells have generated the target outputs in your `/home/user/` directory.
