I will create the required Jupyter Notebook with the data processing steps and then execute it using `jupyter nbconvert`.
I am preparing a Python script that will dynamically generate the Jupyter notebook in your workspace with all the requested data processing, SQL, and visualization steps.

I will now execute the notebook using Jupyter `nbconvert` to generate the SQLite database, SQL report, and visualization.
I will verify that all expected output files (the database, the report CSV, and the plot PNG) were successfully created during the notebook execution.
I will quickly check the content of the generated `revenue_report.csv` file to ensure the column names and data look correct.
I have successfully created and executed the Jupyter Notebook. 

The notebook has performed all the required steps autonomously:
1. **Loaded Data**: Read the records from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
2. **Database Setup**: Created the SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db` and populated the `sales` table.
3. **SQL Reporting**: Calculated the total revenue by `region`, grouping and sorting alphabetically.
4. **Export Data**: Saved the final clean reporting dataset to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` with exactly the requested columns.
5. **Visualization**: Created and saved the bar chart visualization to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

All generated files are now available in your `/home/user/` directory.
