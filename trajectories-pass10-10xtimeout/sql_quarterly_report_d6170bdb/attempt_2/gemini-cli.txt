I have created and executed the Jupyter notebook to prepare the quarterly performance report according to your requirements. 

Here is what was accomplished:
1. **Loaded Data**: Created the notebook at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb` which reads the input dataset from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.
2. **Database Setup**: Initialized a SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db` and loaded the data into the `sales` table.
3. **SQL Reporting**: Executed the `pandas.read_sql` query against the database to calculate total revenue grouped by region and sorted alphabetically.
4. **Export Data**: The results were successfully exported to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` formatted exactly as requested (containing only the `region` and `total_revenue` columns, without the index).
5. **Visualization**: A bar chart was generated, displayed within the notebook, and successfully saved to `/home/user/revenue_plot.png`.

The notebook has been fully executed using `jupyter nbconvert`, and you can now open it to view the inline plot and code cells!
