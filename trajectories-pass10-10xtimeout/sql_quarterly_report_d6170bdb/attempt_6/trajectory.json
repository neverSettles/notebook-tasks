Make sure to execute the notebook once you create it (e.g., using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`).\n\n1. **Load Data**: Read the dataset from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`. \n2. **Database Setup**: Use the `sqlite3` library to create a SQLite database file at `/home/user/sales.db` and load the pandas DataFrame into a table named `sales`.\n3. **SQL Reporting**: Write and execute a SQL query using `pandas.read_sql` against the `sales` table to calculate the total revenue grouped by `region`. Order the results alphabetically by `region`.\n4. **Export Data**: Save the resulting DataFrame from the query to `/home/user/revenue_report.csv` without the index. The columns must be exactly `region` and `total_revenue`.\n5. **Visualization**: Create a simple bar chart of the total revenue by region using matplotlib or seaborn.

My current focus is calculating the total revenue for each region. I plan to group the revenue by region, and sort the output alphabetically by region name to present it more clearly.\nDesigning the Notebook File: I'm now determining the best approach for generating the `.ipynb` file. I'm exploring different methods: direct JSON creation, using `nbformat` in a Python script, or leveraging `jupyter nbconvert` with a standard Python script. I am leaning toward the latter for its simplicity and the ability to ensure the generated notebook's validity. I'm also considering creating the JSON directly.\nImplementing the Notebook Script: I'm now writing the Python script to build the notebook using `nbformat`. I'm starting by establishing the notebook structure and adding a code cell containing the necessary import statements and data processing logic. This includes loading the CSV data, setting up a SQLite database, running an SQL query to calculate revenue by region, exporting the results to a CSV, and generating a bar plot visualization. I'm focusing on the modularity of the code within the notebook cells for maintainability.",
