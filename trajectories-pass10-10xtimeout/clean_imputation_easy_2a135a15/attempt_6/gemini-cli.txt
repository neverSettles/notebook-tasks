I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook with all the requested pandas operations. 

You can find the ready-to-execute notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. It correctly performs the forward fill imputation for revenue, mean imputation for expenses, creates the profit calculation, and saves the final output while retaining the 'Date' index as instructed.
