I will create the requested Jupyter notebook to clean the financial data by writing the necessary pandas operations into a properly formatted `.ipynb` file.
I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. It is formatted as a valid `.ipynb` file and contains the exact pandas operations you requested. It is ready to be executed with the `jupyter nbconvert` command.
