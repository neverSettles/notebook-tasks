I will create the Jupyter notebook with the required data cleaning and imputation steps using pandas.

The Jupyter notebook has been successfully created at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. It is formatted as a valid `.ipynb` file and contains all the requested pandas data cleaning steps. It is now ready to be executed via `jupyter nbconvert`.
