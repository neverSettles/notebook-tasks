I will create the Jupyter Notebook file with the necessary pandas code to clean and impute the financial dataset as requested.

I have created the requested Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. It imports pandas, sets up the DataFrame with the 'Date' index, handles the `ffill()` and mean imputation steps sequentially, calculates the 'Profit', and saves the cleaned output back to a CSV. 

It is perfectly formatted and ready to be executed via `jupyter nbconvert` or interactively.
