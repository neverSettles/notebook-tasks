I will create the Jupyter notebook with the requested data cleaning and imputation steps.
The Jupyter notebook has been created successfully at `/home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb`. It's formatted correctly and includes all your requested pandas data transformations.

You can execute the entire notebook headlessly by running:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/clean_imputation.ipynb
```
