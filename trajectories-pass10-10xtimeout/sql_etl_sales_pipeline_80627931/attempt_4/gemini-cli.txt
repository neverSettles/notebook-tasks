I have created the Jupyter Notebook with the ETL pipeline at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been built correctly and verified. It successfully:
1. Imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`.
2. Loads the `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` dataset into a DataFrame.
3. Loads this DataFrame into an in-memory SQLite database in a table named `sales`.
4. Executes the requested SQL query (using `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC)`) to aggregate revenue per region and rank them.
5. Saves the results to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` with exactly the three requested columns (`region`, `total_revenue`, `sales_rank`) and without the pandas index.
