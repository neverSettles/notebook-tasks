I have created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that perfectly matches your requested ETL pipeline steps. 

It imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`, loads the raw dataset, writes it to an in-memory SQLite database, executes the correct SQL query utilizing the `RANK()` window function for regional revenues, and outputs the resulting DataFrame to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index. 

I've also run it locally to verify that it executes cleanly from top to bottom and produces the three required columns (`region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`).
