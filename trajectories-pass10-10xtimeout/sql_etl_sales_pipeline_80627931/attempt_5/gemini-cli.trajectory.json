Load `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. Create an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`) and write the DataFrame to a table named `sales`.\n4. Execute a SQL query that calculates the total revenue (sum of `amount`) per `region`, and assigns a rank to each region based on their total revenue (highest revenue = rank 1). Use the `RANK()` window function.\n5. Save the result of this query to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index. \nThe output CSV must contain exactly three columns named: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.\n\nEnsure your notebook executes cleanly from top to bottom.

Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",
