I have created the requested ETL pipeline in the Jupyter Notebook `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been built and tested successfully to perform the following:
1. Imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`.
2. Loads `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Provisions an in-memory SQLite database (`:memory:`) and writes the dataframe into a table named `sales`.
4. Executes a SQL query to calculate the `total_revenue` per region, using the `RANK()` window function to assign a `sales_rank` based on total revenue in descending order.
5. Exports the ranked results into `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without indexing, ensuring the final output possesses exactly the required three columns.

The notebook structure is complete and guarantees clean execution from top to bottom.
