I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the specified ETL pipeline steps.
I have created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. It is configured with all the requested steps, including importing the required libraries, loading the CSV, inserting the data into an in-memory SQLite database, running the aggregation and ranking SQL query, and writing the final dataset to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` with exactly the three requested columns and no index. 

You can now run your automated tests against it using `jupyter nbconvert`.
