I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the ETL pipeline instructions you specified.

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` with all the requested ETL steps.

The notebook completes the following tasks when run:
1. Imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`.
2. Loads `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Creates an in-memory SQLite database and saves the DataFrame into a `sales` table.
4. Executes the SQL query with the `SUM()` aggregation and the `RANK()` window function as requested to generate the required columns (`region`, `total_revenue`, `sales_rank`).
5. Extracts the output and writes it to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without including the pandas index. 

It is structured to execute cleanly from top to bottom and should pass your automated tests using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.
