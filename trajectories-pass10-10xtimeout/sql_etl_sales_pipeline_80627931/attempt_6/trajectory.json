I have a raw dataset located at `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`.\n\nCreate a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that performs the following steps:\n1. Import `pandas` and `sqlite3`.\n2. Load `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` into a pandas DataFrame.\n3. Create an in-memory SQLite database (`sqlite3.connect(':memory:')`) and write the DataFrame to a table named `sales`.\n4. Execute a SQL query that calculates the total revenue (sum of `amount`) per `region`, and assigns a rank to each region based on their total revenue (highest revenue = rank 1). Use the `RANK()` window function.\n5. Save the result of this query to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` without the pandas index. \nThe output CSV must contain exactly three columns named: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`.\n\nEnsure your notebook executes cleanly from top to bottom. Automated tests will run your notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` and check the contents of `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`."

      "reasoning_content": "Defining the Requirements: I'm currently focused on defining the precise requirements for this ETL pipeline. The goal is clear: a Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` that imports `pandas` and `sqlite3`. The pipeline must load data from `/home/user/raw_sales.csv`, transform it, and then write the processed data to a SQLite database at `/home/user/sales.db`.\nRefining the Query Logic: I've refined the SQL query within the notebook to calculate total revenue by region and assign sales ranks using `RANK()`. My next step is ensuring the query output has the exact specified columns: `region`, `total_revenue`, and `sales_rank`, saved to a CSV without the pandas index. The in-memory SQLite database setup is also prioritized, and I'm ensuring it's structured properly.\nImplementing the Workflow: I've integrated the in-memory SQLite database connection and the data loading, transformation, and saving to CSV. I'm focusing now on writing the pandas DataFrame to the SQLite database. I have a query that calculates the total revenue by region and assigns sales ranks. Then, I wrote the results to a CSV file `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`. I've added error handling.\nConstructing the Notebook's Code: I'm now drafting the Python code within the Jupyter Notebook. I've focused on importing pandas and sqlite3. I'm building out code to read data from the CSV, create an in-memory SQLite database, write the data to the database, and execute the SQL query to get the required output.\nFinalizing the Implementation: I'm now integrating the final steps. I've successfully implemented reading the SQL query results into a Pandas DataFrame and saving them to the `/home/user/clean_sales.csv` file, without the index. Now, the plan is to use the `write_file` method to create the `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb` notebook with the full code.",
