I will create the Jupyter Notebook file containing the necessary pandas and sqlite3 logic to perform the ETL process.
I have created the requested Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. 

The notebook contains a single executable cell that runs the entire ETL pipeline from top to bottom. It reads the raw CSV, loads it into an in-memory SQLite database, uses the `RANK()` window function as requested to determine the top regions by revenue, and exports the cleanly formatted data (without the pandas index) to `/home/user/clean_sales.csv`. 

It is now ready for your automated testing.
