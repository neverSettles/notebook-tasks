If an item has no valid expenses at all, fill with 0.\n   \n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - Calculate a new column `profit` = `revenue - expenses`.\n   - Map `store_id` to `region_name` using the JSON data. For any `store_id` not found in the JSON, set `region_name` to `\"Unknown\"`.\n   - Filter the dataset to **exclude** any transactions where `profit < 0` (keep only zero or positive profit rows).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - Save the fully cleaned, merged, and filtered dataset to `/home/user/clean_data.csv` (do not include the pandas index).\n   - Create an Excel file `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx` containing two sheets:\n     - Sheet 1 named `\"Region_Profit\"`: Total profit per region, sorted by total profit in descending order. Columns must be `region_name`, `total_profit`.\n     - Sheet 2 named `\"Top_Items\"`: For each region, find the top 2 `item_code`s by total profit. Sort by `region_name` alphabetically, then by profit descending. Columns must be `region_name`, `item_code`, `item_profit`.\n\nThe notebook must be fully executable from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs."

A secondary pass safely assigns `0` to any item that possesses no valid baseline expenses at all.\n\n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - The `profit` column is calculated by subtracting `expenses` from `revenue`.\n   - The `store_id` is joined against the `store_regions` JSON mapping, gracefully falling back to `\"Unknown\"` where store IDs aren't found.\n   - The dataset is filtered down to only keep profitable transactions (`profit >= 0`).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - The finalized dataset is exported cleanly without pandas indices to `/home/user/clean_data.csv`.\n   - The Excel summary (`/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx`) is structured with two required sheets using `pd.ExcelWriter`:\n     - **`Region_Profit`**: Totals profit by region, sorted highest to lowest total profit.\n     - **`Top_Items`**: Slices the top 2 profitable items for each region grouped. It appropriately pre-sorts alphabetically by region name and then descending by item profit.\n\nThe pipeline runs perfectly end-to-end and has been validated against `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.",
