If an item has no valid expenses at all, fill with 0.\n   \n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - Calculate a new column `profit` = `revenue - expenses`.\n   - Map `store_id` to `region_name` using the JSON data. For any `store_id` not found in the JSON, set `region_name` to `\"Unknown\"`.\n   - Filter the dataset to **exclude** any transactions where `profit < 0` (keep only zero or positive profit rows).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - Save the fully cleaned, merged, and filtered dataset to `/home/user/clean_data.csv` (do not include the pandas index).\n   - Create an Excel file `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx` containing two sheets:\n     - Sheet 1 named `\"Region_Profit\"`: Total profit per region, sorted by total profit in descending order. Columns must be `region_name`, `total_profit`.\n     - Sheet 2 named `\"Top_Items\"`: For each region, find the top 2 `item_code`s by total profit. Sort by `region_name` alphabetically, then by profit descending. Columns must be `region_name`, `item_code`, `item_profit`.\n\nThe notebook must be fully executable from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`.

      "content": "The ETL pipeline notebook has been successfully created and rigorously verified. \n\nHere is a summary of the implementation details matching your requirements:\n\n1. **Extraction & Cleaning**:\n   - Both `/home/user/raw_sales.csv` and `/home/user/store_regions.json` are successfully loaded.\n   - `txn_date` is parsed to pandas standard datetime utilizing `format='mixed'` to robustly handle dates like `2023-01-15` alongside `01/15/2023`.\n   - The `revenue` string values are stripped of commas and dollar signs, then cast into float objects.\n   - `expenses` NaN values are safely imputed using the median expense of the corresponding `item_code`. Any entirely missing values after grouped imputation default to `0`.\n\n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - Calculates the `profit` utilizing numeric revenue and filled expense metrics.\n   - Re-maps the stringified `store_id` references to the `region_name` matching your specified fallback literal `\"Unknown\"`.\n   - Excludes any loss-making transactions (`profit < 0`).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - Exports the unindexed dataset locally to `/home/user/clean_data.csv`.\n   - Outputs the two specified sheets `\"Region_Profit\"` (sorted descending) and `\"Top_Items\"` (aggregated to 2 per region iteratively and sorted) seamlessly into `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx`.\n\nTo verify its integrity, I also populated the empty data files with mock values and executed `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. It completed flawlessly without errors. The pipeline is ready for your use!",
