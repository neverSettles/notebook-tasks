If an item has no valid expenses at all, fill with 0.\n   \n2. **Transformation & Merging**:\n   - Calculate a new column `profit` = `revenue - expenses`.\n   - Map `store_id` to `region_name` using the JSON data. For any `store_id` not found in the JSON, set `region_name` to `\"Unknown\"`.\n   - Filter the dataset to **exclude** any transactions where `profit < 0` (keep only zero or positive profit rows).\n\n3. **Aggregation & Loading (Outputs)**:\n   - Save the fully cleaned, merged, and filtered dataset to `/home/user/clean_data.csv` (do not include the pandas index).\n   - Create an Excel file `/home/user/regional_summary.xlsx` containing two sheets:\n     - Sheet 1 named `\"Region_Profit\"`: Total profit per region, sorted by total profit in descending order. Columns must be `region_name`, `total_profit`.\n     - Sheet 2 named `\"Top_Items\"`: For each region, find the top 2 `item_code`s by total profit. Sort by `region_name` alphabetically, then by profit descending. Columns must be `region_name`, `item_code`, `item_profit`.\n\nThe notebook must be fully executable from top to bottom without errors using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs."

Convert the `txn_date` into proper `YYYY-MM-DD` standard datetimes and parse the string `$1,234.56` formatted `revenue` to numerical floats.\n3. Impute missing `expenses` data using the median of that item (or 0 if no valid expenses exist for that item).\n4. Compute the `profit` and apply the `store_id` to `region_name` mapping, leaving missing stores as `\"Unknown\"`.\n5. Filter out negative-profit transactions.\n6. Export the final processed dataframe to `clean_data.csv`.\n7. Generate `regional_summary.xlsx` with the two specified sheets `\"Region_Profit\"` and `\"Top_Items\"`.\n\nYou can now execute it without errors via your `jupyter nbconvert` command!",
