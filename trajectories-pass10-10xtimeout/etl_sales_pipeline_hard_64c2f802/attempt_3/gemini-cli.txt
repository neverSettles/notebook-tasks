I will now create the Jupyter Notebook with the specified ETL pipeline steps, ensuring it properly extracts, transforms, and loads the data into the requested files while being fully executable.

I have successfully created the `etl_pipeline.ipynb` notebook at `/home/user/etl_pipeline.ipynb`. 

The notebook is fully automated to perform your ETL multi-step process from top to bottom. It will:
1. Load `raw_sales.csv` and `store_regions.json`.
2. Convert the `txn_date` into proper `YYYY-MM-DD` standard datetimes and parse the string `$1,234.56` formatted `revenue` to numerical floats.
3. Impute missing `expenses` data using the median of that item (or 0 if no valid expenses exist for that item).
4. Compute the `profit` and apply the `store_id` to `region_name` mapping, leaving missing stores as `"Unknown"`.
5. Filter out negative-profit transactions.
6. Export the final processed dataframe to `clean_data.csv`.
7. Generate `regional_summary.xlsx` with the two specified sheets `"Region_Profit"` and `"Top_Items"`.

You can now execute it without errors via your `jupyter nbconvert` command!
