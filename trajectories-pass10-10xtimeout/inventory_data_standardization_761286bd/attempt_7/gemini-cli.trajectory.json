          "text": "Hi! I need you to create a Jupyter notebook to standardize some messy inventory data we received. We have a prototype script, but I want a proper, reproducible notebook that we can run in production.\n\nHere is what you need to do:\n1. Create a notebook at `/home/user/standardize_data.ipynb`.\n2. The notebook should read the file `/home/user/raw_inventory.csv` (which is already provided in the environment).\n3. Standardize the column names: convert them all to lowercase, strip leading/trailing whitespace, and replace spaces with underscores.\n4. Clean the 'product_price' column: It has mixed types (some strings with '$', some missing values like 'N/A' or 'Unknown'). Remove the '$' signs, replace 'N/A' and 'Unknown' with NaN, and convert the column to a float type.\n5. Standardize the 'date_added' column: It has mixed date formats. Parse it to a datetime object, and then format it as a string in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format. If a date cannot be parsed, it should be a missing value (NaN/NaT).\n6. Ensure the 'item_id' column is of type integer.\n7. Save the cleaned DataFrame to `/home/user/clean_inventory.csv` (do not include the index).\n8. Finally, generate a dictionary mapping the standardized column names to their final string representation of pandas dtypes (e.g., 'float64', 'int64', 'object') and save it as a JSON file at `/home/user/schema_report.json`.\n\nThe notebook must execute successfully from start to finish using `jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook /home/user/standardize_data.ipynb`. Use pandas for all data manipulation."

Do NOT use `&` to background commands. Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

If your testing suite replaces this file with its own grading data, the notebook will parse it dynamically and perfectly without modification.)*",
