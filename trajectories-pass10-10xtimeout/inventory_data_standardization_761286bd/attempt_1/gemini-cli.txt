I have successfully created a reproducible Jupyter Notebook that fulfills all of your requirements for cleaning and standardizing the inventory data. 

Here's an overview of the operations performed in `/home/user/standardize_data.ipynb`:

1. **Imports & Setup:** Initializes `pandas`, `numpy`, and `json`.
2. **Column Standardization:** Converts all column names to lowercase, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and replaces inner spaces with underscores (e.g., `'Item ID'` to `'item_id'`).
3. **Price Cleaning:** Processes `'product_price'` by converting values to string format to uniformly strip `'$'` characters and whitespace. It explicitly maps `'N/A'` and `'Unknown'` texts to `NaN`, then safely casts the column to a numeric `float64` type.
4. **Date Formatting:** Parses the `'date_added'` column by enforcing `pd.to_datetime(..., format='mixed', errors='coerce')` to handle the varying timestamp formats safely. All valid dates are stringified to `'YYYY-MM-DD'`, while any unparseable formats become `NaN` (which maps to empty/null in the final CSV).
5. **ID Casting:** Coerces `'item_id'` sequentially into the pandas robust standard integer type (`int64`).
6. **Data Output:** Saves the cleaned dataset explicitly to `/home/user/clean_inventory.csv` without its index.
7. **Schema Report:** Programmatically generates the data types dictionary and saves it formatted to `/home/user/schema_report.json`.

The notebook has been fully tested using `jupyter nbconvert` locally on the environment's `raw_inventory.csv` and is ready for production.
