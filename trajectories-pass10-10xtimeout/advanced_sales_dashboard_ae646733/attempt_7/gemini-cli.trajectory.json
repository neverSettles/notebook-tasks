          "text": "My colleague was working on a sales dashboard notebook, but they left the company. I need you to create a completely new Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/dashboard.ipynb` that processes the raw sales data and generates the required outputs. The data is messier now and involves multiple currencies.\n\nYou have two input files:\n1. `/home/user/sales_data.csv` (Columns: `Date`, `OrderID`, `Product`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `Currency`)\n2. `/home/user/exchange_rates.csv` (Columns: `Date`, `Currency`, `Rate_to_USD`)\n\nYour notebook must perform the following operations:\n1. **Data Cleaning**: \n   - Parse the `Date` columns in both files. The sales data might have mixed date formats. Convert them to `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Remove any rows from `sales_data.csv` where `Quantity <= 0` or `UnitPrice <= 0` (these are invalid or returns).\n   - Drop rows with missing values in `Quantity` or `UnitPrice`.\n\n2. **Currency Conversion**:\n   - Merge the sales data with the exchange rates. \n   - Note: The exchange rates are only provided for weekdays or specific dates. You must forward-fill missing exchange rates for each currency. If a sales date is before the first available exchange rate for a currency, back-fill it.\n   - Calculate a new column `USD_Revenue` = `Quantity * UnitPrice / Rate_to_USD`.\n\n3. **Aggregation**:\n   - Calculate total daily `USD_Revenue` for all products combined.\n   - Calculate a rolling 7-day average of the daily `USD_Revenue`. (For the first 6 days, the rolling average should be calculated using `min_periods=1`).\n   \n4. **Outputs**:\n   - Save the daily aggregated data to `/home/user/daily_sales.csv`. It must have exactly three columns: `Date`, `Daily_Revenue`, `Rolling_7d_Revenue`. The dates should be sorted chronologically. All float values should be rounded to 2 decimal places.\n   - Save a JSON file `/home/user/metrics.json` containing:\n     - `\"Total_USD_Revenue\"`: Total revenue across all valid rows (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n     - `\"Top_Product\"`: The name of the product with the highest total `USD_Revenue`.\n   - Create a plot of `Date` vs `Rolling_7d_Revenue` and save it as `/home/user/dashboard.png` using matplotlib or seaborn.\n\nThe notebook must be perfectly executable with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/dashboard.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs."
