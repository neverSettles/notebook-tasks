          "text": "My colleague was working on a sales dashboard notebook, but they left the company. I need you to create a completely new Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/dashboard.ipynb` that processes the raw sales data and generates the required outputs. The data is messier now and involves multiple currencies.\n\nYou have two input files:\n1. `/home/user/sales_data.csv` (Columns: `Date`, `OrderID`, `Product`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `Currency`)\n2. `/home/user/exchange_rates.csv` (Columns: `Date`, `Currency`, `Rate_to_USD`)\n\nYour notebook must perform the following operations:\n1. **Data Cleaning**: \n   - Parse the `Date` columns in both files. The sales data might have mixed date formats. Convert them to `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Remove any rows from `sales_data.csv` where `Quantity <= 0` or `UnitPrice <= 0` (these are invalid or returns).\n   - Drop rows with missing values in `Quantity` or `UnitPrice`.\n\n2. **Currency Conversion**:\n   - Merge the sales data with the exchange rates. \n   - Note: The exchange rates are only provided for weekdays or specific dates. You must forward-fill missing exchange rates for each currency. If a sales date is before the first available exchange rate for a currency, back-fill it.\n   - Calculate a new column `USD_Revenue` = `Quantity * UnitPrice / Rate_to_USD`.\n\n3. **Aggregation**:\n   - Calculate total daily `USD_Revenue` for all products combined.\n   - Calculate a rolling 7-day average of the daily `USD_Revenue`. (For the first 6 days, the rolling average should be calculated using `min_periods=1`).\n   \n4. **Outputs**:\n   - Save the daily aggregated data to `/home/user/daily_sales.csv`. It must have exactly three columns: `Date`, `Daily_Revenue`, `Rolling_7d_Revenue`. The dates should be sorted chronologically. All float values should be rounded to 2 decimal places.\n   - Save a JSON file `/home/user/metrics.json` containing:\n     - `\"Total_USD_Revenue\"`: Total revenue across all valid rows (rounded to 2 decimal places).\n     - `\"Top_Product\"`: The name of the product with the highest total `USD_Revenue`.\n   - Create a plot of `Date` vs `Rolling_7d_Revenue` and save it as `/home/user/dashboard.png` using matplotlib or seaborn.\n\nThe notebook must be perfectly executable with `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/dashboard.ipynb`. Do not use external APIs."

Do NOT use `&` to background commands. Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

      "content": "I have successfully created and tested the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/dashboard.ipynb`.\n\nHere is a summary of how the notebook fulfills your requirements:\n1. **Data Cleaning**: It parses the mixed-format `Date` columns cleanly. Invalid rows containing `Quantity <= 0`, `UnitPrice <= 0`, or missing values for these columns are properly filtered out.\n2. **Currency Conversion**: It generates a complete date range mapping for every currency, forward-filling first and then back-filling to ensure rates are seamlessly imputed across weekends and missing days. It precisely calculates `USD_Revenue = Quantity * UnitPrice / Rate_to_USD`.\n3. **Aggregation & Processing**: The valid daily transactions are aggregated chronologically. In cases of dates with zero sales, it safely reindexes the timeline to ensure the 7-day rolling average calculates correctly over real calendar days (with `min_periods=1`).\n4. **Output Generation**: \n   - Generates `/home/user/daily_sales.csv` with exactly three columns (`Date`, `Daily_Revenue`, `Rolling_7d_Revenue`) and floats rounded to 2 decimal places. \n   - Produces `/home/user/metrics.json` containing the total revenue and the top-performing product.\n   - Plots the 7-day rolling revenue using `matplotlib` and exports the visualization to `/home/user/dashboard.png`.\n\nThe notebook is structurally pure, and fully executable from end-to-end using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/dashboard.ipynb`. I have tested it via CLI, and it handles all operations flawlessly without any external API usage.",
