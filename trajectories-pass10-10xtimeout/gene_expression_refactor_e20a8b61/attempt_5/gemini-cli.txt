I will now create the requested Jupyter Notebook that sequentially processes the gene expression data.
I will briefly verify the logic by running the equivalent Python commands.
I am verifying the generated output file to ensure the structure and results meet your requirements.
I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` following your specific requirements.

It contains three distinct cells that sequentially:
1. Import pandas, load the dataset, and calculate the mean for each gene (excluding `sample`).
2. Filter the results for mean expression strictly greater than `50` (which correctly isolated `gene_C` and `gene_D`).
3. Create a two-column DataFrame and save it locally to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without an index.

I have also verified the internal logic by running an equivalent Python script; it executes perfectly and generates the required CSV cleanly.
