I will now create the Jupyter Notebook file with the necessary steps to analyze the gene expression data, ensuring it fulfills all your requirements and can be executed without errors.
I will now execute a test run of the Python code using a shell command to ensure it runs completely without errors and generates the correct output CSV file.
I am testing the python environment to verify the script using the correct python executable.
I will now check the contents of the generated significant genes file to make sure the data structure matches the requested format.
I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook for your gene expression analysis. 

The notebook is located at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` and is structured exactly as you requested:

*   **Cell 1**: Imports `pandas`, loads the dataset from `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`, and calculates the mean expression per gene by dropping the `sample` column.
*   **Cell 2**: Filters these means to strictly retain only genes with an expression > 50.
*   **Cell 3**: Generates a DataFrame with precisely two columns (`Gene` and `Mean_Expression`) and saves the results directly to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the index. 

I have also verified the logic against the actual CSV. The resulting code operates cleanly without errors.
