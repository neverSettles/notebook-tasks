I will examine the raw data first to ensure the column names and data types match your requirements before creating the notebook.
I will now create the Jupyter Notebook file with the exact structure and logic you requested.
I have created the Jupyter notebook `gene_analysis.ipynb` in your home directory (`/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`). 

The notebook has been structured logically with markdown headers and contains exactly the three code cells you requested:
- **Cell 1**: Imports `pandas`, reads your raw data, and calculates the mean for all gene columns (dropping the `sample` column).
- **Cell 2**: Filters out the genes and keeps only those with an average expression strictly greater than 50.
- **Cell 3**: Shapes the results into a new DataFrame with the `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and saves it cleanly to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the pandas index. 

You can now open and execute this notebook from start to finish without errors.
