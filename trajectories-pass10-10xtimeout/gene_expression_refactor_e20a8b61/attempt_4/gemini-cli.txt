I will generate a Jupyter Notebook with the specified cells to process your raw gene expression data. 
The Jupyter Notebook has been successfully created. You can find your new analysis notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. It is set up with exactly three clean, well-commented cells:

1.  **Data Loading & Calculation**: Imports `pandas`, reads the raw data, and calculates the mean expression for all genes excluding the `sample` column.
2.  **Filtering**: Filters those calculated means to strictly keep values `> 50`.
3.  **Report Generation**: Formats the filtered results into a clean DataFrame with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and writes it out to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without an index. 

You can execute it end-to-end to generate the report!
