I'll create the Jupyter notebook with the data analysis steps you've described.

I have created the Jupyter notebook for you at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been structured exactly as requested, divided into three cells:
1. **Cell 1**: Imports pandas, loads `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`, drops the `sample` column, and calculates the mean expression for all remaining gene columns.
2. **Cell 2**: Filters these means down to only those strictly greater than 50.
3. **Cell 3**: Formats the filtered results into a DataFrame with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and saves the final result to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the index. 

You can now open the notebook in Jupyter and run all cells from top to bottom! Let me know if you need any adjustments to the analysis.
