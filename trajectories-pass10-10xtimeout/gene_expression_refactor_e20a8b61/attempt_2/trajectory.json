I need you to create a clean, well-documented Jupyter notebook that performs the analysis steps clearly.\n\nThere is a raw dataset located at `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`. \n\nPlease create a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` that does the following:\n\n**Cell 1: Data Loading & Calculation**\n- Import pandas.\n- Load `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`.\n- Calculate the mean expression for each gene (all columns except the `sample` column).\n\n**Cell 2: Filtering**\n- Filter the calculated means to keep ONLY the genes with a mean expression strictly greater than 50.\n\n**Cell 3: Report Generation**\n- Create a DataFrame from the filtered results with exactly two columns: `Gene` and `Mean_Expression`.\n- Save this DataFrame to a CSV file at `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the index (`index=False`).\n\nThe notebook must be executable from start to finish without errors."

      "reasoning_content": "Defining the Project Scope: I'm now zeroing in on the core request: crafting a Jupyter notebook that leverages pandas to analyze the provided gene data. My immediate focus is dissecting the user's implicit and explicit requirements to shape a suitable framework and identify crucial analysis stages. I'll need to know what analysis is to be performed to generate the desired outputs.\nOutlining the Notebook's Structure: I've formulated a preliminary structure for the Jupyter notebook, focusing on three key cells. The first cell will import pandas and load the gene data, calculating the mean expression per gene. The second cell will apply a filter, selecting genes with mean expression above 50, and the third creates a DataFrame for output and saves it as a CSV. I've also checked and confirmed how to ignore the 'sample' column for the mean calculation.\nRefining the Code Cells: I've finalized the code cells! The initial cell now imports pandas and reads the CSV, calculating the mean expression. Next, I'm filtering for genes with an average expression exceeding 50. Lastly, a DataFrame is created from the filtered genes and exported as a CSV, and I've ensured no index column is output.\nConstructing the Notebook's Body: I'm now drafting the core of the Jupyter notebook, with Python cells crafted in a modular way. I've focused on creating individual cells for importing the data, filtering based on mean expression, and generating a report DataFrame. I've ensured that 'sample' column is accounted for, and that the index is excluded from the output. The code is running smoothly now!\nGenerating the Notebook's Output: I'm working on the final output now, focusing on the CSV export using `/home/user/significant_genes.csv`. I'm verifying the index-exclusion implementation within the `to_csv()` function. Furthermore, I've confirmed the output includes only the relevant gene information for the report, and the raw expression values. I'm focusing on validating that the output captures the expression and filtering steps correctly.\nValidating the CSV Output: I'm now putting the finishing touches on the CSV generation, meticulously ensuring data accuracy. The filtering process appears to be correctly implemented, and I've verified the report DataFrame includes only genes exceeding the threshold. I'm double-checking that the output is exactly as specified. I'm also finalizing the notebook's documentation to ensure future users can reproduce the analysis easily.",
