I will read the raw gene data file to confirm its structure and then generate the requested Jupyter Notebook.
I will now create the requested Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` containing the specified data processing steps in three distinct cells.
I will run the equivalent Python code to verify the logic and ensure it executes completely without errors.

I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` according to your requirements. 

It contains three distinct cells that handle the full pipeline:
1. **Cell 1**: Imports pandas, loads `/home/user/raw_gene_data.csv`, and calculates the mean expression for each gene, explicitly ignoring the `sample` column.
2. **Cell 2**: Filters these means to keep only genes with an average expression strictly greater than 50.
3. **Cell 3**: Formats the results into a new DataFrame containing exactly the `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and saves it to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the DataFrame index.

The notebook is fully structured as valid JSON under the `.ipynb` standard and is ready to execute from start to finish without errors.
