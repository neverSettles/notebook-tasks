I will investigate the raw gene data file to understand its structure before creating the Jupyter notebook.
I will now create the Jupyter Notebook file containing the requested analysis steps.
I will execute a quick verification script to ensure the logic works without errors.
I'll verify that the generated results match the expected output.
I have created the Jupyter notebook `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb` with the specified three cells. The notebook will correctly load the data, filter for mean expressions strictly greater than 50, and save the results cleanly to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv`.
