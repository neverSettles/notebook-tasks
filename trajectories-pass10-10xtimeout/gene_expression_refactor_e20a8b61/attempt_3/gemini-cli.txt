I'll check the structure of the raw data first to ensure the pandas code handles it correctly.
I'll write the Jupyter Notebook matching your exact specifications.
I'll run a quick test to ensure the generated notebook executes from start to finish without errors.
I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook `gene_analysis.ipynb` with the requested cells and proper documentation. 

The notebook is fully executable from start to finish. I've also verified the logic: it successfully imports pandas, calculates the means while excluding the `sample` column, filters for values `> 50`, and saves the structured `significant_genes.csv` without the index.
