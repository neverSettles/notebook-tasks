I'll check the structure of the raw data to ensure the notebook handles it correctly, and then I will write the Jupyter notebook.
I'll create the Jupyter notebook (`/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`) directly, incorporating your exact requirements into 3 clean, well-commented code cells.
I'll verify that the logic executes successfully from start to finish by running the notebook's code.
I have successfully created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. 

The notebook has been structured with exactly three well-documented cells that meet all your requirements:

1. **Cell 1** imports `pandas`, loads the raw dataset, drops the `sample` column, and calculates the mean for all genes.
2. **Cell 2** strictly filters the dataset to retain only the genes with a mean expression `> 50`.
3. **Cell 3** formats the final results into a new `DataFrame` with `Gene` and `Mean_Expression` columns, and saves it to `/home/user/significant_genes.csv` without the index. 

I've also verified the logic locally to guarantee the notebook will execute from start to finish without errors.
