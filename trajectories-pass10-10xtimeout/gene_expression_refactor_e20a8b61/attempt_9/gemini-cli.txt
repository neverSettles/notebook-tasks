I will now create the Jupyter Notebook with the specified cells to process the gene expression data.
I will now test the code logic within a python script to ensure it executes without errors as requested.
I'll verify that the `significant_genes.csv` output was successfully generated by the test.
The Jupyter notebook has been successfully created and saved at `/home/user/gene_analysis.ipynb`. It is partitioned into the three specific cells as requested, and I've also verified that its code executes correctly, successfully calculating and filtering the expression data to output `/home/user/significant_genes.csv`.
