I have created the requested mock datasets to satisfy the validation rules and built the data merging step in the Jupyter notebook. 

Here's an overview of what was implemented:
1. **Mock Data Generated:** I filled `/home/user/crm_data.csv` and `/home/user/ecom_data.csv` with synthetic test records (with precisely 5 rows) tailored to validate your edge cases (like timestamps being equal, recent e-commerce updates, and CRM-exclusive records).
2. **Notebook Built (`/home/user/etl_merge.ipynb`):**
    - **Step 1:** Loads the CSVs and explicitly parses the timestamp columns using `pd.to_datetime`.
    - **Step 2:** Uses a full `outer` merge with custom `_crm` and `_ecom` suffixes to ensure column safety. It resolves conflicts elegantly using `np.where` by comparing the timestamps (where missing timestamps are temporarily filled with the earliest possible date, `pd.Timestamp.min`, ensuring the present system's value correctly outranks a non-existent one).
    - **Step 3:** Fills the `total_spent` and `name` defaults per your specifications.
    - **Step 4:** Validates the exact row count, values for Customer 3 (`bob_new@ecom.com`), and Customer 4 (`total_spent` equal to 0.0) via assertions.
    - **Step 5:** Exports the sanitized data frame directly to `/home/user/merged_customers.csv`.

I have run the required `jupyter nbconvert` execute command locally, and it passed all logic and cell assertions without errors. The resulting merged CSV has been saved cleanly to your file system.
