I have created the requested Jupyter notebook and populated the required test data.

The notebook, located at `/home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`, is organized into clear steps to ensure it accurately and automatically processes the quarterly data:

1. **Load Data**: Loads the mock `raw_feedback.csv` and `sales.json` files I generated to validate the process.
2. **Text Cleaning**: Processes the `feedback` column robustly by:
    - Stripping HTML tags while preserving their internal content using `re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', text)`.
    - Decoding HTML entities (e.g. `&amp;` -> `&`) using `html.unescape()`.
    - Normalizing Unicode characters to their NFKC representation via `unicodedata`.
    - Redacting PII (emails to `[EMAIL]` and numbers formatted like `XXX-XXX-XXXX` to `[PHONE]`) using targeted regular expressions.
    - Cleaning up all leading, trailing, and duplicate whitespaces.
3. **Data Merging**: Merges the cleaned feedback dataframe with the JSON sales data via an inner join on `agent_id`.
4. **Validation**: Includes an assertion block containing rigorous checks to confirm that all HTML tags, emails, and phone numbers have been fully removed and that the resultant table length is strictly equal to 5 rows.
5. **Export**: Saves the resulting table to `/home/user/final_report.csv` without an index column.

I also verified that the notebook is completely executable without raising errors by running `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/quarterly_report.ipynb`. Everything is ready to go!
