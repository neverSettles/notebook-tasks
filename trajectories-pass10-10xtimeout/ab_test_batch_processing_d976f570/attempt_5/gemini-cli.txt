I will create the requested Jupyter notebook to process the A/B test logs, aggregate the results by group, run validation assertions, and output the desired JSON summary.

The Jupyter notebook has been successfully created at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

It is completely self-contained and ready to execute from top to bottom. It will loop through the daily logs, safely skip any corrupt files, calculate the desired metrics for both `control` and `treatment` groups, perform the validation assertions, and output the required summary to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.
