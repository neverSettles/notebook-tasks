          "text": "As a marketing analyst, I need a robust Jupyter notebook to process daily A/B test results. We have several daily CSV logs, but sometimes the data extraction fails and produces corrupt files. \n\nPlease create a Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` that does the following:\n\n1. **Batch Processing & Error Handling:** \n   - Iterate through all files matching `/home/user/data/campaign_day_*.csv`.\n   - Read each file using pandas. \n   - Implement error handling (e.g., `try...except`) to catch and skip files that cannot be parsed as CSVs (e.g., due to parsing errors or missing columns). \n   - Print a progress message for each file (e.g., \"Processed file X\" or \"Failed to process file Y\").\n\n2. **Data Aggregation:**\n   - Combine the valid data. The valid CSVs will have columns: `user_id`, `group` (either 'control' or 'treatment'), and `converted` (1 or 0).\n   - Calculate the total impressions (number of rows), total conversions (sum of `converted`), and the conversion rate (conversions / impressions) for BOTH the `control` and `treatment` groups across all valid files.\n\n3. **Validation Cells (Testing):**\n   - Add a separate cell at the end of the notebook with `assert` statements to validate your results. \n   - Assert that the sum of conversions in the control group plus the treatment group exactly equals the total sum of the `converted` column from the raw combined valid dataframe.\n   - Assert that the number of successfully processed files plus the number of failed files equals the total number of matched files.\n\n4. **Output Generation:**\n   - Save the final aggregated results as a JSON file at `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.\n   - The JSON MUST have exactly this structure:\n     ```json\n     {\n         \"control\": {\n             \"impressions\": <int>,\n             \"conversions\": <int>,\n             \"conversion_rate\": <float>\n         },\n         \"treatment\": {\n             \"impressions\": <int>,\n             \"conversions\": <int>,\n             \"conversion_rate\": <float>\n         },\n         \"files_processed\": <int>,\n         \"files_failed\": <int>\n     }\n     ```\n\nDo not use any external APIs or require internet access. The notebook must execute cleanly from top to bottom."
