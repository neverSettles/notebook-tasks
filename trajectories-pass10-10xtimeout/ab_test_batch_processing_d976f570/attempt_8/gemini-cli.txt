I will write the Jupyter notebook containing the requested data processing logic, error handling, aggregations, and validation assertions to `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`.

I have successfully created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

It includes the following cells:
1. **Batch Processing & Error Handling:** Uses `pandas` and `try...except` blocks to iterate through `/home/user/data/campaign_day_*.csv`, verifying CSV integrity and required columns, then printing the processing status of each file.
2. **Data Aggregation:** Concatenates all valid datasets, segregates them into `control` and `treatment` groups, and calculates total impressions, total conversions, and conversion rates for both.
3. **Output Generation:** Structures the aggregated statistics exactly as requested and saves the JSON output to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.
4. **Validation Cells:** Contains a separate, final cell with the two required `assert` statements to ensure file counts and conversion sums match exactly. 

The notebook is fully self-contained without relying on any external APIs or internet access and can be executed cleanly from top to bottom.
