I will create the requested Jupyter notebook to process the A/B testing CSV files, aggregate the data, save it to the specified JSON format, and include the necessary validation tests.

The notebook has been successfully created at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

It is designed to cleanly iterate over your CSV logs, cleanly bypass corrupted files via proper `try...except` handling, calculate your requested group aggregations, assert data correctness using the validation logic, and finally output to the requested `ab_test_summary.json` structured file. It's ready to be executed from top to bottom.
