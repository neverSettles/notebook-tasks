I will create the requested Jupyter notebook to process the A/B test data, perform the aggregations, and add the validation checks.

I have created the Jupyter notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` as requested. 

It handles everything sequentially from top to bottom:
1. **Batch Processing & Error Handling:** Uses `glob` to iterate through the `.csv` files and safely catches parsing or validation issues via a `try...except` block, outputting progress messages.
2. **Data Aggregation:** Leverages `pandas` to combine the successful files, calculating `impressions`, `conversions`, and `conversion_rate` for both the `control` and `treatment` groups.
3. **JSON Output Generation:** Dumps the required structured aggregate results exactly to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.
4. **Validation Cells:** Includes a final block of `assert` statements to mathematically prove that the parsed file counts match the total files discovered, and the sum of all separated conversions strictly equals the conversions in the raw combined dataset.
