I will create the Jupyter Notebook with the required data processing, aggregation, output generation, and validation steps.

The Jupyter Notebook has been successfully created at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb`. 

It performs all the requested tasks:
- **Batch Processing:** Iterates over the specified daily files with robust `try...except` handling and prints progress for each.
- **Data Aggregation:** Calculates `impressions`, `conversions`, and `conversion_rate` for the `control` and `treatment` groups.
- **Output Generation:** Saves the aggregated statistics and processing counts strictly into the requested JSON schema at `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.
- **Validation:** Contains a final cell with the required assertions to validate total conversions and complete file counts without failing.

You can now open and run the notebook top-to-bottom.
