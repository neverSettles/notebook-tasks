I will now write the Jupyter notebook to handle the batch processing, data aggregation, result output, and validations.
I have created the Jupyter Notebook at `/home/user/ab_test_batch.ipynb` per your specifications. It will efficiently handle the file parsing, silently ignore corrupt or incorrectly formatted CSVs using standard `try...except` handling, calculate your requested A/B test metrics, validate its math via assertions, and output exactly the specified JSON payload to `/home/user/ab_test_summary.json`.
