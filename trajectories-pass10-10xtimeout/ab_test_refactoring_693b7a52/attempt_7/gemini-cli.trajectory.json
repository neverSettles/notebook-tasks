It works, but I need to present this to stakeholders. \n\nPlease convert this script into a well-structured Jupyter Notebook named `/home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`. \n\nHere is what you need to do:\n1. Read the provided `messy_ab_test.py` and `campaign_data.csv` in `/home/user/`.\n2. Create a new notebook `/home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`.\n3. Break the script down into logical, sequential cells:\n   - Cell 1: Import libraries\n   - Cell 2: Data Loading (load `campaign_data.csv`)\n   - Cell 3: Data Preprocessing & Summary (calculate conversion rates for each group)\n   - Cell 4: Statistical Testing (perform the chi-square test)\n   - Cell 5: Visualization (bar chart of conversion rates)\n   - Cell 6: Export Results\n4. Add descriptive Markdown cells *before* each code cell explaining what the next block of code does (e.g., \"## 1. Import Libraries\", \"## 2. Data Loading\").\n5. The notebook must produce the following outputs when executed:\n   - Save a bar chart of the conversion rates as `/home/user/conversion_plot.png`.\n   - Save the grouped summary data (Group, Total Visitors, Converted, Conversion Rate) as `/home/user/summary_stats.csv`.\n   \nMake sure the notebook runs perfectly from start to finish using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute /home/user/ab_test_analysis.ipynb`."

Do NOT use `&` to background commands. Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",
