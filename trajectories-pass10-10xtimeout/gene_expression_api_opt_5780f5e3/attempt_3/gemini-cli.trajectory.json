The notebook works and saves the data, but it is too slow because it fetches the 20 pages sequentially. Each request takes about 0.5 seconds, so the whole process takes over 10 seconds. \n\nYour task is to optimize the notebook to complete the data collection in under 3 seconds. You must use parallel execution (e.g., `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) to fetch the pages concurrently.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Modify `/home/user/fetch_data.ipynb`.\n2. Fetch all 20 pages (pages 1 to 20 inclusive) using the `get_expression_data(page)` function from the provided `mock_api` module.\n3. Combine all retrieved records into a single pandas DataFrame.\n4. Sort the DataFrame by the `gene_id` column in ascending order.\n5. Save the final DataFrame to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without the index.\n6. The entire execution of the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` must take less than 4 seconds.\n\nThe `mock_api.py` module and the slow `fetch_data.ipynb` are already in `/home/user`."

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, CNRI\n         hereby grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide\n         license to reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly,\n         prepare derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use Python 1.6.1\n         alone or in any derivative version, provided, however, that CNRI's\n         License Agreement and CNRI's notice of copyright, i.e., \"Copyright (c)\n         1995-2001 Corporation for National Research Initiatives; All Rights\n         Reserved\" are retained in Python 1.6.1 alone or in any derivative\n         version prepared by Licensee.  Alternately, in lieu of CNRI's License\n         Agreement, Licensee may substitute the following text (omitting the\n         quotes): \"Python 1.6.1 is made available subject to the terms and\n         conditions in CNRI's License Agreement.

Nothing in this\n         License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of\n         agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.

Trademarks.\n         \n         This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,\n         service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for\n         reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and\n         reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n         \n         7. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n         \n         Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the\n         Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied,\n         including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,\n         NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n         ==========================\n         \n         Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\n         Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\n         as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\n         principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n         \n         In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\n         National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\n         in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\n         software.\n         \n         In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\n         BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\n         year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\n         Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\n         https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\n         created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\n         Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n         \n         All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\n         the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\n         releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\n         the various releases.\n         \n             Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                             from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n             a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n             GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n             other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n         \n         (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n             because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n             CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n             is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n         \n         Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\n         direction to make these releases possible.\n         \n         \n         B.

          "description": "This tool executes a given shell command as `bash -c <command>`. To run a command in the background, set the `is_background` parameter to true. Do NOT use `&` to background commands. Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

It dynamically handles the returned data structures, combines them into a single pandas DataFrame, sorts by `gene_id` in ascending order, and saves the results to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without the index. \n\nSince the mock API introduces a ~0.5-second delay per request, parallelizing all 20 requests allows the entire data retrieval step to finish in just over half a second, ensuring the entire execution via `jupyter nbconvert --execute` finishes comfortably within the 4-second requirement limit.",
