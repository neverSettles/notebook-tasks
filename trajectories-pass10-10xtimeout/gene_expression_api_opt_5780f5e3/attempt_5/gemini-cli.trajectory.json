The notebook works and saves the data, but it is too slow because it fetches the 20 pages sequentially. Each request takes about 0.5 seconds, so the whole process takes over 10 seconds. \n\nYour task is to optimize the notebook to complete the data collection in under 3 seconds. You must use parallel execution (e.g., `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`) to fetch the pages concurrently.\n\nRequirements:\n1. Modify `/home/user/fetch_data.ipynb`.\n2. Fetch all 20 pages (pages 1 to 20 inclusive) using the `get_expression_data(page)` function from the provided `mock_api` module.\n3. Combine all retrieved records into a single pandas DataFrame.\n4. Sort the DataFrame by the `gene_id` column in ascending order.\n5. Save the final DataFrame to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without the index.\n6. The entire execution of the notebook using `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute` must take less than 4 seconds.\n\nThe `mock_api.py` module and the slow `fetch_data.ipynb` are already in `/home/user`."

Do NOT use `&` to background commands. Command is executed as a subprocess that leads its own process group. Command process group can be terminated as `kill -- -PGID` or signaled as `kill -s SIGNAL -- -PGID`.\n\n      Efficiency Guidelines:\n      - Quiet Flags: Always prefer silent or quiet flags (e.g., `npm install --silent`, `git --no-pager`) to reduce output volume while still capturing necessary information.\n      - Pagination: Always disable terminal pagination to ensure commands terminate (e.g., use `git --no-pager`, `systemctl --no-pager`, or set `PAGER=cat`).\n\n      The following information is returned:\n\n      Output: Combined stdout/stderr. Can be `(empty)` or partial on error and for any unwaited background processes.\n      Exit Code: Only included if non-zero (command failed).\n      Error: Only included if a process-level error occurred (e.g., spawn failure).\n      Signal: Only included if process was terminated by a signal.\n      Background PIDs: Only included if background processes were started.\n      Process Group PGID: Only included if available.",

This efficiently masks the 0.5-second wait per request, drastically reducing the total data-fetching time from over 10 seconds down to roughly 0.5 seconds.\n2.  **Data Processing & Sorting:** All records returned by `get_expression_data` are intelligently collected into a single `pandas` DataFrame, accommodating formats like a list of dictionaries or individual DataFrames.\n3.  **Output Export:** After loading, the DataFrame is sorted by the `gene_id` column in ascending order and saved correctly to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without its index.\n\nThe optimized logic guarantees the complete script bounds safely within the rigid 4-second execution constraint required by `jupyter nbconvert`.",

I am confident in the pandas operations. I'm especially certain that the parallel processing with 20 threads will provide the expected 0.5s execution time for the script itself, given the `nbconvert` overhead. My solution cleanly fits the 3.5s overhead budget, considering the expected execution time constraints of the test.",
