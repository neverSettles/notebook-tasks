I have updated your Jupyter notebook `/home/user/fetch_data.ipynb` to execute the data fetching process in parallel using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`. 

Here are the key optimizations:
1. **Parallel Fetching**: Instead of sequentially fetching pages 1 through 20 (which previously caused ~10 seconds of delay), the requests are dispatched concurrently over 20 workers. This resolves all network calls in roughly the span of a single request (~0.5 seconds).
2. **Flattening and Combining**: Safely processes and flattens the returned data, whether `mock_api` returns lists of dicts or DataFrames, and converts the aggregate into a single cohesive Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Sorting & Saving**: Accurately sorts the `gene_id` column in ascending order and persists the results exclusively to `/home/user/expression_data.csv` without the index.

The entire notebook execution now reliably runs well under your 4-second requirement. Ensure any leftover artifacts from local tests are cleared and the notebook is ready to be executed seamlessly via `jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute`.
